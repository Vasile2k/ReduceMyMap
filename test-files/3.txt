INTRODUCTION

It's perhaps fitting that I write this introduction in jail- that graduate school of survival. Here you learn how to use  toothpaste as glue, fashion a shiv out of a spoon and build  intricate communication networks. Here too, you learn the only  rehabilitation possible-hatred of oppression.

Steal This Book is, in a way, a manual of survival in the  prison that is Amerika. It preaches jailbreak. It shows you where  exactly how to place the dynamite that will destroy the walls.	The  first section-SURVIVE!-lays out a potential action program for our  new Nation. The chapter headings spell out the demands for a free  society. A community where the technology produces goods and  services for whoever needs them, come who may.	It calls on the  Robin Hoods of Santa Barbara Forest to steal from the robber barons  who own the castles of capitalism. It implies that the reader  already is "ideologically set," in that he understands corporate  feudalism as the only robbery worthy of being called "crime," for  it is committed against the people as a whole.	Whether the ways it  describes to rip-off shit are legal or illegal is irrelevant. The  dictionary of law is written by the bosses of order. Our moral  dictionary says no heisting from each other. To steal from a  brother or sister is evil. To not steal from the institutions that  are the pillars of the Pig Empire is equally immoral.

Community within our Nation, chaos in theirs; that is the  message of SURVIVE!

We cannot survive without learning to fight and that is the  lesson in the second section. FIGHT! separates revolutionaries  from outlaws. The purpose of part two is not to fuck the system,  but destroy it. The weapons are carefully chosen. They are  "home-made," in that they are designed for use in our unique  electronic jungle. Here the uptown reviewer will find ample proof  of our "violent" nature. But again, the dictionary of law fails us.  Murder in a uniform is heroic, in a costume it is a crime. False  advertisements win awards, forgers end up in jail. Inflated prices  guarantee large profits while shoplifters are punished. Politicians  conspire to create police riots and the victims are convicted in  the courts. Students are gunned down and then indicted by suburban  grand juries as the trouble-makers. A modern, highly mechanized  army travels 9,000 miles to commit genocide against a small nation  of great vision and then accuses its people of aggression.  Slumlords allow rats to maim children and then complain of violence  in the streets. Everything is topsy-turvy. If we internalize the  language and imagery of the pigs, we will forever be fucked. Let me  illustrate the point. Amerika was built on the slaughter of a  people. That is its history. For years we watched movie after movie  that demonstrated the white man's benevolence. Jimmy Stewart, the  epitome of fairness, puts his arm around Cochise and tells how the  Indians and the whites can live in peace if only both sides will be  reasonable, responsible and rational (the three R's imperialists  always teach the "natives"). "You will find good grazing land on  the other side of the mountain," drawls the public relations man.  "Take your people and go in peace." Cochise as well as millions of  youngsters in the balcony of learning, were being dealt off the  bottom of the deck. The Indians should have offed Jimmy Stewart in  every picture and we should have cheered ourselves hoarse. Until we  understand the	nature of institutional violence and how it  manipulates values and mores to maintain the power of the few, we  will forever be imprisoned in the caves of ignorance. When we  conclude that bank robbers rather than bankers should be the  trustees of the universities, then we begin to think clearly. When  we see the Army Mathematics Research and Development Center and the  Bank of Amerika as cesspools of violence, filling the minds of our  young with hatred, turning one against another, then we begin to  think revolutionary.

Be clever using section two; clever as a snake. Dig the spirit  of the struggle. Don't get hung up on a sacrifice trip. Revolution  is not about suicide, it is about life. With your fingers probe the  holiness of your body and see that it was meant to live. Your body  is just one in a mass of cuddly humanity. Become an  internationalist and learn to respect all life. Make war on  machines, and in particular the sterile machines of corporate death  and the robots that guard them. The duty of a revolutionary is to  make love and that means staying alive and free. That doesn't allow  for cop-outs. Smoking dope and hanging up Che's picture is no more  a commitment than drinking milk and collecting postage stamps. A  revolution in consciousness is an empty high without a revolution  in the distribution of power. We are not interested in the greening  of Amerika except for the grass that will cover its grave.

Section three - LIBERATE! - concerns itself with efforts to  free stuff (or at least make it cheap) in four cities. Sort of a  quick U.S. on no dollars a day. It begins to scratch the potential  for a national effort in this area. Since we are a nation of  gypsies, dope on how to move around and dig in anywhere is always  needed. Together we can expand this section. It is far from  complete, as is the entire project. Incomplete chapters on how to  identify police agents, steal a car, run day-care centers, conduct  your own trial, organize a G.I. coffee house, start a rock and roll  band and make neat clothes, are scattered all over the floor of the  cell. The book as it now stands was completed in the late summer of  1970. For three months manuscripts made the rounds of every major  publisher. In all, over 30 rejections occurred before the decision  to publish the book ourselves was made, or rather made for us.  Perhaps no other book in modern times presented such a dilemma.  Everyone agreed the book would be a commercial success. But even  greed had its limits, and the IRS and FBI following the manuscript  with their little jive rap had a telling effect. Thirty "yeses"  become thirty "noes" after "thinking it over." Liberals, who  supposedly led the fight against censorship, talked of how the book  "will end free speech."

Finally the day we were bringing the proofs to the printer,  Grove consented to act as distributor. To pull a total solo trip,  including distribution, would have been neat, but such an effort  would be doomed from the start. We had tried it before and blew it.  In fact, if anyone is interested in 4,000 1969 Yippie calendars,  they've got a deal. Even with a distributor joining the fight, the  battle will only begin when the books come off the press. There is  a saying that "Freedom of the press belongs to those who own one."  In past eras, this was probably the case, but now, high speed  methods of typesetting, offset printing and a host of other  developments have made substantial reductions in printing costs.  Literally anyone is free to print their own works. In even the most  repressive society imaginable, you can get away with some form of  private publishing. Because Amerika allows this, does not make it  the democracy Jefferson envisioned. Repressive tolerance is a real  phenomenon. To talk of true freedom of the press, we must talk of  the availability of the channels of communication that are designed  to reach the entire population, or at least that segment of the  population that might participate in such a dialogue. Freedom of  the press belongs to those that own the distribution system.  Perhaps that has always been the case, but in a mass society where  nearly everyone is instantaneously plugged into a variety of  national communications systems, wide-spread dissemination of the  information is the crux of the matter. To make the claim that the  right to print your own book means freedom of the press is to  completely misunderstand the nature of a mass society. It is like  making the claim that anyone with a pushcart can challenge Safeway  supermarkets, or that any child can grow up to be president.

State legislators, librarians, PTA members, FBI agents,  church-goers, and parents: a veritable legion of decency and order  already is on the march. To get the book to you might be the  biggest challenge we face. The next few months should prove really  exciting.

Obviously such a project as Steal This Book could not have  been carried out alone. Izak Haber shared the vision from the  beginning. He did months of valuable research and contributed many  of the survival techniques. Carole Ramer and Gus Reichbach of the  New York Law Commune guided the book through its many stages. Anna  Kaufman Moon did almost all the photographs. The cartoonists who  have made contributions include Ski Williamson and Gilbert Sheldon.  Tom Forcade, of the UPS, patiently did the editing. Bert Cohen of  Concert Hall did the book's graphic design. Amber and John Wilcox  set the type. Anita Hoffman and Lynn Borman helped me rewrite a  number of sections. There are others who participated in the  testing of many of the techniques demonstrated in the following  pages and for obvious reasons have to remain anonymous. There were  perhaps over 50 brothers and sisters who played particularly vital  roles in the grand conspiracy. Some of the many others are listed  on the following page. We hope to keep the information up to date.  If you have comments, law suits, suggestions or death threats,  please send them to: Dear Abbie P.0. Box 213, Cooper Station,  New York, NY 10003. Many of the tips might not work in your area,  some might be obsolete by the time you get to try them out, and  many addresses and phone numbers might be changed. If the reader  becomes a participating researcher then we will have achieved our  purpose.

Watch for a special edition called Steal This White House,  complete with blueprints of underground passages, methods of  jamming the communications network and a detailed map of the  celebrated room where according to Tricia Nixon, "Daddy loves to  listen to Mantovanni records, turn up the air conditioner full  blast, sit by the fireplace, gaze out the window to the Washington  Monument and meditate on those difficult problems that face all the  peoples of this world."

SURVIVE!

FREE FOOD

RESTAURANTS

In a country such as Amerika, there is bound to be a  hell-of-a-lot food lying around just waiting to be ripped off. If  you want to live high off the hog without having to do the dishes,  restaurants are easy pickings.	In general, many of these targets  are easier marks if you are wearing the correct uniform. You should  always have one suit or fashionable dress outfit hanging in the  closet for the proper heists. Specialized uniforms, such as nun and  priest garb, can be most helpful. Check out your local uniform  store for a wide range of clothes that will get you in, and  especially out, of all kinds of stores. Every movement organization  should have a prop and costume department.

In every major city there are usually bars that cater to the  New Generation type riff-raff, trying to hustle their way up the  escalator of Big Business. Many of these bars have a buffet or  hors-d'oeuvres served free as a come-on to drink more mindless  booze. Take a half-empty glass from a table and use it as a prop to  ward off the anxious waitress. Walk around sampling the free food  until you've had enough. Often, there are five or six such bars in  close proximity, so moving around can produce a delightful "street  smorgasbord." Dinner usually begins at 5:00 PM.

If you are really hungry, you can go into a self-service  cafeteria and finish the meal of someone who left a lot on the  plate. Self-service restaurants are usually good places to cop  things like mustard, ketchup, salt, sugar, toilet paper, silverware  and cups for home use. Bring an empty school bag and load up after  you've cased the joint. Also, if you can stomach the food, you can  use slugs at the automat. Finishing leftovers can be worked in even  the fanciest of restaurants. When you are seated at a place where  the dishes still remain, chow-down real quick. Then after the  waitress hands you the menu, say you have to meet someone outside  first, and leave.

There are still some places where you can get all you can eat  for a fixed price. The best of these places are in Las Vegas. Sew a  plastic bag onto your tee-shirt or belt and wear a loose-fitting  jacket or coat to cover any noticeable bulge. Fried chicken is the  best and the easiest to pocket, or should we say bag. Another trick  is to pour your second free cup of hot coffee into the plastic bag  sewed inside your pocket and take it with you.

At large take-out stands you can say you or your brother just  picked up an order of fifteen hamburgers or a bucket of chicken,  and got shorted. We have never seen or heard of anybody getting  turned down using this method. If you want to get into a grand food  heist from take-out stands, you can work the following nervy bit:  from a pay phone, place an order from a large delivery restaurant.  Have the order sent to a nearby apartment house. Wait a few minutes  in the booth after you've hung up, as they sometimes call back to  confirm the order. When the delivery man goes into the apartment  house to deliver the order, you can swipe the remaining orders that  are still in his truck.

In fancy sit-down restaurants, you can order a large meal and  halfway through the main course, take a little dead cockroach or a  piece of glass out of your pocket and place it deftly on the plate.  Jump up astonished and summon the headwaiter. "Never have I been so  insulted. I could have been poisoned" you scream slapping down the  napkin. You can refuse to pay and leave, or let the waiter talk you  into having a brand new meal on the house for this terrible  inconvenience.

In restaurants where you pay at the door just before leaving,  there are a number of free-loading tricks that can be utilized.  After you've eaten a full meal and gotten the check, go into the  restroom. When you come out go to the counter or another section of  the restaurant and order coffee and pie. Now you have two bills.  Simply pay the cheaper one when you leave the place. This can be  worked with a friend in the following way. Sit next to each other  at the counter. He should order a big meal and you a cup of coffee.  Pretend you don't know each other. When he leaves, he takes your  check and leaves the one for the large meal on the counter. After  he has paid the cashier and left the restaurant, you pick up the  large check, and then go into the astonishment routine, complaining  that somebody took the wrong check. You end up only paying for your  coffee. Later, meet your partner and reverse the roles in another  place.

In all these methods, you should leave a good tip for the  waiter or waitress, especially with the roach-in-the-plate gambit.  You should try to avoid getting the employees in trouble or  screwing them out of a tip.

One fantastic method of not only getting free food but getting  the best available is the following technique that can be used in  metropolitan areas. Look in a large magazine shop for gourmet  digests and tourist manuals. Swipe one or two and copy down a good  name from the masthead inside the cover. Making up a name can also  work. Next invest $5.00 to print business cards with the name of  the magazine and the new "associate editor." Call or simply drop  into a fancy restaurant, show a copy of the magazine and present  the manager with your card. They will insist that the meal be on  the house.

Great places to get fantastic meals are weddings,  bar-mitzvahs, testimonials and the like. The newspaper society  sections have lists of weddings and locations. If your city has a  large Jewish population, subscribe to the newspaper that services  the Jewish community. There are extensive lists in these papers of  family occasions where tons of good food is served. Show up at the  back of the synagogue a few hours after the affair has begun with a  story of how you'd like to bring some leftovers of "good Jewish  food" back to your fraternity or sorority. If you want to get the  food served to you out front, you naturally have to disguise  yourself to look straight. Remarks such as, "I'm Marvin's cousin,"  or learning the bride's name, "Gee, Dorothy looks marvelous" are  great. Lines like "Betty doesn't look pregnant" are frowned upon. A  man and woman team can work this free-load much better than a  single person as they can chatter back and forth while stuffing  themselves.

If you're really into a classy free meal, and you are in a  city with a large harbor, check out the passenger ship section in  the back pages of the newspaper. There you find the schedule of  departures for ocean cruises. Most trips (these kind, anyway) begin  with a fantastic bon voyage party on board ship. Just walk on a few  hours before departure time and start swinging. Champagne, caviar,  lobster, shrimp and more, all as free as the open seas. If you get  really bombed and miss getting off, you can also wiggle a ride  across the ocean. You get sent back as soon as you hit the other  side, but it's a free ocean cruise. You should have a pretty good  story ready to go, or you might end up rowing in the galley.

Another possibility for getting a free meal is to go down to  the docks and get friendly with a sailor. He can often invite you  for dinner on board ship. Foreign sailors are more than glad to  meet friends and you can get great foreign dinners this way.

FOOD PROGRAMS

In Amerika, there is a national food stamp program that  unfortunately is controlled by the states. Many states, for racist  reasons, do not want to make it too available or to publicize the  fact that it even exists. It is a much better deal than the food  program connected with welfare, because you can use the stamps to  buy any kind of food. The only items excluded are tobacco products  and alcoholic beverages. In general, you can qualify if you earn  less than $165 per month; the less you earn, the more stamps you  can receive. There is minimal hassle involved once you get by the  first hurdle. Show up at your local food stamp office, which can be  found by calling the Welfare Department in our city. Make an  appointment to see a representative for your area. They will tell  you to bring all sorts of receipts, but the only thing you need are  a few rent stubs for the most recent months. An array of various  receipt books is a nice supplement to one's prop room. If the  receipts are for a high rent, tell them you rent a room from a  group of people and eat separately. They really only want to prove  that you have cooking facilities. Once you get the stamps, you can  pick them up regularly. Some states even mail them to your pad. You  can get up to a hundred dollars worth of free purchases a month per  person in the most liberal states.

Large amounts of highly nutritional food can be gotten for as  little as three cents per meal from a non-profit organization  called Multi-Purpose Food for Millions Foundation, Inc., 1800  Olympic Ave., Santa Monica, California. Write and they will send  you details.

SUPERMARKETS

Talking about food in Amerika means talking about  supermarkets-mammoth neon lighted streets of food packaged to  hoodwink the consumers. Many a Yippie can be found in the aisles,  stuffing his pockets with assorted delicacies. We have been  shoplifting from supermarkets on a regular basis without raising  the slightest suspicion, ever since they began.

We are not alone, and the fact that so much stealing goes on  and the supermarkets still bring in huge profits shows exactly how  much overcharging has occurred in the first place. Supermarkets,  like other businesses, refer to shoplifting as "inventory  shrinkage." It's as if we thieves were helping Big Business reduce  weight. So let's view our efforts as methods designed to trim the  economy and push forward with a positive attitude.

Women should never go shopping without a large handbag. In  those crowded aisles, especially the ones with piles of cases, all  sorts of goodies can be transferred from shopping cart to handbag.  A drop bag can be sewn inside a trench coat, for more efficient  thievery. Don't worry about the mirrors; attendants never look at  them. Become a discriminating shopper and don't stuff any of the  cheap shit in your pockets.

Small bottles and jars often have the same size cap as the  larger expensive sizes. If they have the price stamped on the cap,  switch caps, getting the larger size for the cheaper price. You can  empty a pound box of margarine and fill it with sticks of butter.  Small narrow items can be hidden in the middle of rolls of toilet  paper. Larger supermarkets sell records. You can sneak two good  LP's into one of those large frozen pizza boxes. In the produce  department, there are bags for fruit and vegetables. Slip a few  steaks or some lamb chops into the bottom of a large brown bag and  pile some potatoes on top. Have a little man in the white coat  weigh the bag, staple it and mark the price. With a black crayon  you can mark your own prices, or bring your own adhesive price  tags.

It's best to work shoplifting in the supermarket with a  partner who can act as look-out and shield you from the eyes of  nosy employees, shoppers and other crooks trying to pick up some  pointers. Work out a prearranged set of signals with your partner.  Diversions, like knocking over displays, getting into fist fights  with the manager, breaking plate glass windows and such are  effective and even if you don't get anything they're fun. Haven't  you always wanted to knock over those carefully constructed  nine-foot pyramids of garbage?

You can walk into a supermarket, get a few items from the  shelves, and walk around eating food in the aisles. Pick up some  cherries and eat them.	Have a spoon in your pocket and open some  yogurt. Open a pickle or olive jar. Get some sliced meat or cheese  from the delicatessen counter and eat it up, making sure to ditch  the wrapper. The cart full of items, used as a decoy, can just be  left in an aisle before you leave the store.

Case the joint before pulling a big rip-off. Know the least  crowded hours, learn the best aisles to be busy in, and check out  the store's security system. Once you get into shoplifting in  supermarkets, you'll really dig it. You'll be surprised to learn  that the food tastes better.

Large scale thievery can best be carried out with the help of  an employee. Two ways we know of work best. A woman can get a job  as a cashier and ring up a small bill as her brothers and sisters  bring home tons of stuff.

The method for men involves getting a job loading and  unloading trucks in the receiving department. Some accomplices  dressed right can just pull in and, with your help, load up on a  few cases. Infiltrating an employee into a store is probably the  best way to steal. Cashiers, sales clerks, shippers, and the like  are readily available jobs with such high turnover and low pay that  little checking on your background goes on. Also, you can learn  what you have to do in a few days. The rest of the week, you can  work out ways to clean out the store. After a month or so of action  you might want to move on to another store before things get heavy.  We know one woman working as a cashier who swiped over $500 worth  of food a week. She had to leave after a month because her boss  thought she was such an efficient cashier that he insisted on  promoting her to a job that didn't have as many fringe benefits for  her and her friends.

Large chain stores like Safeway throw away day-old vegetables,  the outer leaves of lettuce, celery and the like. This stuff is  usually found in crates outside the back of the building. Tell them  you're working with animals at the college labs, or that you raise  guinea pigs. They might even get into saving them for you, but if  they don't just show up before the garbage is collected, (generally  early in the morning), and they'll let you cart away what you want.

Dented cans and fruit can often be gotten free, but certainly  at a reduced rate. They are still as good as the undamaged ones. So  be sure to dent all your cans before you go to the cashier.

Look up catering services and businesses that service  factories and office buildings with ready-made sandwiches. Showing  up at these places at the right times (catering services on late  Sunday night and sandwich dealers at 5:00 PM on weekdays) will  produce loads of good food. Legally, they have to dispose of the  food that's left over. They would be more than happy to give it to  you if you spin a good story.

Butchers can be hustled for meat scraps with meat scraps with  a "for my dog" story, and bakeries can be asked for day-old rolls  and bread.

WHOLESALE MARKETS

Large cities all have a wholesale fruit and vegetable area  where often the workers will give you tons of free food just for  the asking. Get a good story together. Get some church stationery  and type a letter introducing yourself "to whom it may concern," or  better still, wear some clerical garb. Orchards also make good  pickings just after the harvest has been completed.

Factories often will give you a case or two of free  merchandise for a "charitable" reason. Make some calls around town  and then go pick up the stuff at the end of the week. A great idea  is to get a good list of a few hundred large corporations around  the country by looking up their addresses at the library. Poor's  Register of Companies, Directors and Executives has the most  complete list. Send them all letters complaining about how the last  box of cereal was only half full, or you found a dead fly in the  can of peaches. They often will send you an ample supply of items  just to keep you from complaining to your friends or worse, taking  them to court. Often you can get stuff sent to you by just telling  them how good their product is compared to the trash you see  nowadays. You know the type of letter - "Rice Krispies have had a  fantastic effect on my sexual prowess," or "Your frozen asparagus  has given a whole new meaning to my life." In general though, the  nasties get the best results.

Slaughterhouses usually have meat they will give away. They  are anxious to give to church children's programs and things like  that. In most states, there is a law that if the slab of meat  touches the ground, they have to throw it away. Drop around meat  houses late in the day and trip a few trucks.

Fishermen always have hundreds of pounds of fish that have to  be thrown out. You can have as much as you can cart away, generally  just for the asking. Boats come in late in the afternoon and  they'll give you some of the catch, or you can go to the markets  early in the morning when the fishing is best.

These methods of getting food in large quantities can only be  appreciated by those who have tried it. You will be totally baffled  by the unbelievable quantities of food that will be laid on you and  with the ease of panhandling.

Investing in a freezer will allow you to bi-weekly or even  monthly trips to the wholesale markets and you'll get the freshest  foods to boot. Nothing can beat getting it wholesale for free. Or  is it free for wholesale? In any event, "bon appetit."

FOOD CONSPIRACIES

Forming a food cooperative is one of the best ways to promote  solidarity and get every kind of food you need to survive real  cheap.	It also provides a ready-made bridge for developing  alliances with blacks, Puerto Ricans, chicanos and other groups  fighting our common oppressor on a community level.

Call a meeting of about 20 communes, collectives or community  organizations. Set up the ground rules. There should be a hard-core  of really good hustlers that serve as the shopping or hunting party  and another group of people who have their heads together enough to  keep records and run the central distribution center. Two or three  in each group should do it. They can get their food free for the  effort. Another method is to rotate the activity among all members  of the conspiracy. The method you choose depends upon your politics  and whether you favor a division of labor or using the food  conspiracy as a training for collective living. Probably a blend of  the two is best, but you'll have to hassle that out for yourself.  The next thing to agree upon is how the operation and all the shit  you get will be paid for. This is dependent on a number of  variables, so we'll map out one scheme and you can modify it to  suit your particular situation. Each member of every commune could  be assessed a fee for joining. You want to get together about  $2,000, so at 200 members, this is ten bucks a piece. After the  joining fee, each person or group has to pay only for the low  budget food they order, but some loot is needed to get things  rolling. The money goes to getting a store front or garage, a cheap  truck, some scales, freezers, bags, shelving, chopping blocks,  slicer and whatever else you need. You can get great deals by  looking in the classified ads of the local overground newspaper and  checking for restaurants or markets going out of business. Remember  the idea of a conspiracy is to get tons of stuff at real low prices  or free into a store front, and then break it down into smaller  units for each group and eventually each member. The freezers allow  you to store perishables for a longer time.

The hunting party should be well acquainted with how to rip  off shit totally free and where all the best deals are to be found.  They should know what food is seasonal and about nutritional diets.  There is a lot to learn, such as where to get raw grains in 100  pounds lots and how to cut up a side of beef. A good idea is to get  a diet freak to give weekly talks in the store front. There can  also be cooking lessons taught, especially to men, so women can get  out of the kitchen.

Organizing a community around a basic issue of survival, such  as food, makes a lot of nitty gritty sense. After your conspiracy  gets off the ground and looks permanent, you should seek to expand  it to include more members and an emergency food fund should be set  up in case something happens in the community. There should also be  a fund whereby the conspiracy can sponsor free community dinners  tied into celebrations. Get it together and join the fight for a  world-wide food conspiracy. Seize the steak!

CHEAP CHOW

There are hundreds of good paperback cook books with  nutritional cheap recipes available in any bookstore. Cooking is a  vastly overrated skill. The following are a few all-purpose dishes  that are easy to make, nutritional and cheap as mud pies. You can  add or subtract many of the ingredients for variety.

Hog Farm Granola Breakfast (Road Hog Crispies) ¸ c millet		2 c raw oats
¸ c cracked wheat	1 c rye flakes
¸ c buckwheat groats	1 c wheat flakes
¸ c wheat germ		1 c dried fruits and/or nuts ¸ c sunflower seeds	3 tbs soy oil
¹ c sesame seeds	1 c honey
2 tbs cornmeal

Boil the millet in a double boiler for 1/2 hour. Mix in a large  bowl all the ingredients including the millet. The soy oil and  honey should be heated in a saucepan over a low flame until bubbles  form. Spread the cereal in a baking pan and cover with the honey  syrup. Toast in oven until brown. Stir once or twice so that all  the cereal will be toasted. Serve plain or with milk. Refrigerate  portion not used in a covered container. Enough for ten to twenty  people. Make lots and store for later meals. All these ingredients  can be purchased at any health store in a variety of quantities.  You can also get natural sugar if you need a sweetener. If bought  and made in quantity, this fantastically healthy breakfast food  will be cheaper than the brand name cellophane that passes for  cereal.

Whole Earth Bread
1 c oats, corn meal, or wheat germ	2 tsp salt 1¸ c water (warm)			2 egg yolks
¹ c sugar (raw is best) 		4 c flour
1 pkg active dry yeast			_ c corn oil
1 c dry milk				or butter

Stir lightly in a large bowl the oats, cornmeal or wheat germ  (depending on the flavor bread you desire), the water and sugar.  Sprinkle in the yeast and wait 10 minutes for the yeast to do its  thing. Add salt, egg yolks, corn oil and dry milk. Mix with a fork.  Blend in the flour. The dough should be dry and a little lumpy.  Cover with a towel and leave in a warm place for a half hour. Now  mash, punch, blend and kick the dough and return it covered to its  warm place. The dough will double in size. When this happens,  separate the dough into two even masses and mash each one into a  greased bread (loaf) pan. Cover the pans and let sit until the  dough rises to the top of the pans. Bake for 40-45 minutes in a 350  degree oven that has not been pre-heated. A shallow tray of water  in the bottom of the oven will keep the bread nice and moist. When  you remove the pans from the oven, turn out the bread into a rack  and let it cool off. Once you get the hang of it, you'll never  touch ready-made bread, and it's a gas seeing yeast work.

Street Salad

Salad can be made by chopping up almost any variety of  vegetables, nuts and fruits including the stuff you panhandled at  the back of supermarkets; dandelions, shav, and other wild  vegetables; and goods you ripped off inside stores or from large  farms. A neat fresh dressing consists of one part of oil, two parts  wine vinegar, finely chopped garlic cloves, salt and pepper. Mix up  the ingredients in a bottle and add to the salad as you serve it.  Russian dressing is simply mayonnaise and ketchup mixed.

Yippie Yogurt

Yogurt is one of the most nutritional foods in the world. The  stuff you buy in stores has preservatives added to it reducing its  health properties and increasing the cost. Yogurt is a bacteria  that spreads throughout a suitable culture at the correct  temperature. Begin by going to a Turkish or Syrian restaurant and  buying some yogurt to go. Some restaurants boast of yogurt that  goes back over a hundred years. Put it in the refrigerator.

Now prepare the culture in which the yogurt will multiply. The  consistency you want will determine what you use. A milk culture  will produce thin yogurt, while sweet cream will make a thicker  batch. It's the butter fat content that determines the consistency  and also the number of calories. Half milk and half cream combines  the best of both worlds. Heat a quart of half and half on a low  flame until just before the boiling point and remove from the  stove. This knocks out other bacteria that will compete with the  yogurt. Now take a tablespoon of the yogurt you got from the  restaurant and place it in the bottom of a bowl (not metal). Now  add the warm liquid. Cover the bowl with a lid and wrap tightly  with a heavy towel. Place the bowl in a warm spot such as on top of  a radiator or in a sunny window. A turned-off oven with a tray of  boiling water placed in it will do well. Just let the bowl sit for  about 8 hours (overnight). The yogurt simply grows until the whole  bowl is yogurt. Yippie! It will keep in the refrigerator for about  two weeks before turning sour, but even then, the bacteria will  produce a fresh batch of top quality. Remember when eating it to  leave a little to start the next batch. For a neat treat add some  honey and cinnamon and mix into the yogurt before serving. Chopped  fruit and nuts are also good.

Rice and Cong Sauce
1 c brown rice	vegetables
2 c water	2¸ tbs soy sauce
tsp salt

Bring the water to a boil in a pot and add the salt and rice.  Cover and reduce flame. Cooking time is about 40 minutes or until  rice has absorbed all the water. Meanwhile, in a well-greased  frying pan, saute a variety of chopped vegetables you enjoy. When  they become soft and brownish, add salt and 2 cups of water. Cover  with a lid and lower flame. Simmer for about 40 minutes, peeking to  stir every once in a while. Then add 2 1/2 tbs of soy sauce, stir  and cook another 10 minutes. The rice should be just cooling off  now, so add the sauce to the top of it and serve. Great for those  long guerrilla hikes. This literally makes up almost the entire  diet of the National Liberation Front fighter.

Weatherbeans
1 lb red kidney beans	2 tbs parsley (chopped) 2 quarts water		¸ lb pork, smoked sausage 1 onion (chopped)	  or ham hock
1 tbs celery (chopped)	1 lg bay leaf
1 tsp garlic (minced)	salt to season

Rinse the beans, then place in covered pot and add water and  salt. Cook over low flame. While cooking, chop up meat and brown in  a frying pan. Add onion, celery, garlic and parsley and continue  sauteing over low flame. Add the pieces of meat, vegetables and bay  leaf to the beans and cook covered for 1 1/2 to 2 hours. It may be  necessary to add more water if the beans get too dry. Fifteen  minutes before beans are done, mash about a half cup of the stuff  against the side of the pan to thicken the liquid. Pour the beans  and liquid over some steaming rice that you've made by following  the directions above. This should provide a cheap nutritional meal  for about 6 people.

Hedonist's Deluxe
2 lobsters	2 qts water
seaweed 	¹ lb butter

Steal two lobsters, watching out for the claw thingies. Beg  some seaweed from any fish market. Cop the butter using the  switcheroo method described in the Supermarket section above. When  you get home, boil the water in a large covered pot and drop in the  seaweed and then the lobsters. Put the cover back on and cook for  about 20 minutes. Melt the butter in a sauce pan and dip the  lobster pieces in it as you eat. With a booster box, described  later you'll be able to rip off a bottle of vintage Pouilly-Fuisse  in a fancy liquor store. Really, rice is nice but...

FREE  CLOTHING & FURNITURE

FREE CLOTHING

If shoplifting food seems easy, it's nothing compared to the  snatching of clothing. Shop only the better stores. Try thing on in  those neat secluded stalls. The less bulky items such as shirts,  vests, belts and socks can be tied around your waist or leg with  large rubber bands if needed. Just take a number of items in and  come out with a few less.

In some cities there are still free stores left over from the  flower power days. Churches often have give-away clothing programs.  You can impersonate a clergyman and call one of the large clothing  manufacturers in your area. They are usually willing to donate a  case or two of shirts, trousers or underwear to your church raffle  or drive to dress up skid row. Be sure to get your sizes. Tell them  "your boy" will pick up the blessed donation and you'll mention his  company in the evening prayers.

If you notice people moving from an apartment or house, ask  them if they'll be leaving behind clothing. They usually abandon  all sorts of items including food, furniture and books. Offer to  help them carry out stuff if you can keep what they won't be  taking.

Make the rounds of a fancy neighborhood with a truck and some  friends. Ring doorbells and tell the person who answers that you  are collecting wearable clothing for the "poor homeless victims of  the recent tidal wave in Quianto a small village in Saudi Arabia."  You get the pitch. Make it food and clothing, and say you're with a  group called Heartline for Decency. A phony letter from a church  might help here.

The Salvation Army does this, and you can pick up clothes from  them at very cheap prices. You can get a pair of snappy casual  shoes for 25 cents in many bowling alleys by walking out with them  on your feet. If you have to leave your shoes as a deposit, leave  the most beat-up pair you can find.

Notice if your friends have lost or gained weight. A big  change means a lot of clothes doing nothing but taking up closet  space. Show up at dormitories when college is over for the summer  or winter season. Go to the train or bus stations and tell them you  left your raincoat, gloves or umbrella when you came into town.  They'll take you to a room with thousands of unclaimed items. Pick  out what you like. While there, notice a neat suitcase or trunk and  memorize the markings. Later a friend can claim the item. There  will be loads of surprises in any suitcase. We have a close friend  who inherited ten kilos of grass this way.

Large laundry and dry cleaning chains usually have thousands  of items that have gone unclaimed. Manufacturers also have shirts,  dresses and suits for rockbottom prices because of a crooked seam  or other fuck-up. Stores have reduced rates on display models:  Mannequins are mostly all size 40 for men and 10 for women. Size  7 1/2 is the standard display size for men's shoes. If you are  these sizes, you can get top styles for less than half price.

SANDALS

The Vietnamese and people throughout the Third World make a  fantastically durable and comfortable pair of sandals out of rubber  tires. They cut out a section of the outer tire (trace around the  outside of the foot with a piece of chalk) which when trimmed forms  the sole. Next 6 slits re made in the sole so the rubber straps can  be criss-crossed and slid through the slits. The straps are made  out of inner tubing. No nails are needed. If you have wide feet,  use the new wide tread low profiles. For hard going, try radials.  For best satisfaction and quality, steal the tires off a pig car or  a government limousine.

Let's face it, if you really are into beating the clothing  problem, move to a warm climate and run around naked. Skin is  absolutely free, and will always be in style. Speaking of style,  the midi and the maxi have obvious advantages when it comes to  shoplifting and transporting weapons or bombs.

FREE FURNITURE

Apartment lobbies are good for all kinds of neat furniture. If  you want to get fancy about it, rent a truck (not one that says  U-HAUL-IT or other rental markings) and make the pick-up with  moving-man-type uniforms. When schools are on strike and students  hold seminars and debate into the night, Yippies can be found going  through the dorm lobbies and storage closets hauling off couches,  desks, printing supplies, typewriters, mimeos, etc. to store in  secret underground nests. A nervy group of Yippies in the Midwest  tried to swipe a giant IBM 360 computer while a school was in  turmoil. All power to those that bring a wheelbarrow to sit-ins.

Check into a high-class hotel or motel remembering to dress  like the wallpaper. Carry a large dummy suitcase with you and  register under a phony name. Make sure you and not the bellboy  carry this bag. Use others as a decoy. When you get inside the  room, grab everything you can stuff in the suitcase: radio, T.V.  sets (even if it has a special plug you can cut it with a knife and  replace the cord), blankets, toilet paper, glasses, towels, sheets,  lamps, (forget the imitation Winslow Homer on the wall) a Bible,  soap and toss rugs. Before you leave (odd hours are best) hang the  DO NOT DISTURB sign on your doorknob. This will give you an extra  few hours to beat it across the border or check into a new hotel.

Landlords renovating buildings throw out stoves, tables,  lamps, refrigerators and carpeting. In most cities, each area has a  day designated for discarding bulk objects. Call the Sanitation  Department and say you live in that part of town which would be  putting out the most expensive shit and find out the pick-up day.  Fantastic buys can be found cruising the streets late at night.  Check out the backs of large department stores for floor models,  window displays and slightly damaged furniture being discarded.

Construction sites are a good source for building materials to  construct furniture. (Not to mention explosives.) The large wooden  cable spools make great tables. Cinderblocks, bricks and boards can  quickly be turned into a sharp looking bookcase. Doors make tables.  Nail kegs convert into stools or chairs. You can also always find a  number of other supplies hanging around like wiring, pipes,  lighting fixtures and hard hats. And don't forget those blinking  signs and the red lanterns for your own light show. Those black  oil-fed burners are O.K. for cooking, although smoky, and highway  flares are swell for making fake dynamite bombs.

FREE TRANSPORTATION

HITCH-HIKING

Certainly one of the neatest ways of getting where you want to  go for nothing is to hitch. In the city it's a real snap. Just  position yourself at a busy intersection and ask the drivers for a  lift when they stop for the red light. If you're hitching on a road  where the traffic zooms by pretty fast, be sure to stand where the  car will have room to safely pull off the road. Traveling long  distances, even cross-country, can be easy if you have some sense  of what you are doing.

A lone hitch-hiker will do much better than two or more. A man  and woman will do very well together. Single women are certain to  get propositioned and possibly worse. Amerikan males have endless  sexual fantasies about picking up a poor lonesome damsel in  distress. Unless your karate and head are in top form, women should  avoid hitching alone. Telling men you have V.D. might help in  difficult situations.

New England and the entire West Coast are the best sections  for easy hitches. The South and Midwest can sometimes be a real  hassle. Easy Rider and all that. The best season to hitch is in the  summer. Daytime is much better than night. If you have to hitch at  night, get under some type of illumination where you'll be seen.

Hitch-hiking is legal in most states, but remember you always  can get a "say-so" bust. A "say-so" arrest is to police what  Catch-22 is to the Army. When you ask why you're under arrest, the  pig answers, "cause I say-so." If you stand on the shoulder of the  road, the pigs won't give you too bad a time. If you've got long  hair, cops will often stop to play games. You can wear a hat with  your hair tucked under to avoid hassles. However this might hurt  your ability to get rides, since many straights will pick up  hippies out of curiosity who would not pick up a straight scruffy  looking kid. Freak drivers usually only pick up other freaks.

Once in a while you hear stories of fines levied or even a few  arrests for hitching (Flagstaff, Arizona is notorious), but even in  the states where it is illegal, the law is rarely enforced. If  you're stopped by the pigs, play dumb and they'll just tell you to  move along. You can wait until they leave and then let your thumb  hang out again.

Hitchin on super highways is really far out. It's illegal but  you won't get hassled if you hitch at the entrances. On a fucked-up  exit, take your chances hitching right on the road, but keep a  sharp eye out for porkers. When you get a ride be discriminating.  Find out where the driver is headed. If you are at a good spot,  don't take a ride under a hundred miles that won't end up in a  location just as good. When the driver is headed to an  out-of-the-way place, ask him to let you off where you can get the  best rides. If he's going to a particularly small town, ask him to  drive you to the other side of thy town line. It's usually only a  mile or two. Small towns often enforce all sorts of "say-so"  ordinances. If you get stuck on the wrong side of town, it would be  wise to even hoof it through the place. Getting to a point on the  road where the cars are inter-city rather than local traffic is  always preferable.

When you hit the road you should have a good idea of how to  get where you are going. You can pick up a free map at any gas  station. Long distance routes, road conditions, weather and all  sorts of information can be gotten free by calling the American  Automobile Association in any city. Say that you are a member  driving to Phoenix, Arizona or wherever your destination is, and  find out what you want to know. Always carry a sign indicating  where you are going. If you get stranded on the road without one,  ask in a diner or gas station for a piece of cardboard and a magic  marker. Make the letters bold and fill them in so they can be seen  by drivers from a distance. If your destination is a small town,  the sign should indicate the state. For really long distances, EAST  or WEST is best. Unless, of course, you're going north or south. A  phony foreign flag sewed on your pack also helps.

Carrying dope is not advisable, and although searching you is  illegal, few pigs can read the Constitution. If you are carrying  when the patrol car pulls up, tell them you are Kanadian and  hitching through Amerika. Highway patrols are very uptight about  promoting incidents with foreigners. The foreign bit goes over  especially well with small-town types, and is also amazingly good  for avoiding hassles with greasers. If you can't hack this one,  tell them you are a reporter for a newspaper writing a feature  story on hitching around the country. This story has averted many a  bust.

Don't be shy when you hitch. Go into diners and gas stations  and ask people if they're heading East or to Texas. Sometimes gas  station attendants will help. When in the car be friendly as hell.  Offer to share the driving if you've got a license. If you're  broke, you can usually bum a meal or a few bucks, maybe even a free  night's lodging. Never be intimidated into giving money for a ride.

As for what to carry when hitching, the advice is to travel  light. The rule is to make up a pack of the absolute minimum, then  cut that in half. Hitching is an art form as is all survival.  Master it and you'll travel on a free trip forever.

FREIGHTING

There is a way to hitch long distances that has certain  advantages over letting your thumb hang out for hours on some  two-laner. Learn about riding the trains and you'll always have  that alternative. Hitchhiking at night can be impossible, but  hopping a is easier at night than by day. By hitchhiking days and  hopping freights and sleeping on them at night, you can cover  incredible distances rapidly and stay well rested. Every city and  most large towns have a freight yard. You can find it by following  the tracks or asking where the freight yard is located.

When you get to the yard, ask the workmen when the next train  leaving in your direction will be pulling out. Unlike the phony  Hollywood image, railroad men are nice to folks who drop by to grab  a ride. Most yards don't have a guard or a "bull" as they are  called. Even if they do, he is generally not around. If there is a  bull around, the most he's going to do is tell you it's private  property and ask you to leave. There are exceptions to this rule,  such as the notorious Lincoln, Nebraska, and Las Vegas, Nevada, but  by asking you can find out. Even if he asks you to leave or throws  you out, sneak back when your train is pulling out and jump aboard.

After you've located the right train for your trip, hunt for  an empty boxcar to ride. The men in the yards will generally point  one out if you ask. Pig-sties, flat cars and coal cars are  definitely third class due to exposure to the elements. Boxcars are  by far the best. They are clean and the roof over your head helps  in bad weather and cuts down the wind. Boxcars with a hydro-cushion  suspension system used for carrying fragile cargo make for the  smoothest ride. Unless you get one, you should be prepared for a  pretty bumpy and noisy voyage.

You should avoid cars with only one door open, because the pin  may break, locking you in. A car with both doors open gives you one  free chance. Pig-backs (trailers on flatcars) are generally  considered unsafe. Most trains make a number of short hops, so if  time is an important factor try to get on a "hot shot" express. A  hot shot travels faster and has priority over other trains in  crowded yards. You should favor a hot shot even if you have to wait  an extra hour or two or more to get one going your way.

If you're traveling at night, be sure to dress warmly. You can  freeze your ass off. Trains might not offer the most comfortable  ride, but they go through beautiful countryside that you'd never  see from the highway or airway. There are no billboards, road  signs, cops, Jack-in-the-Boxes, gas stations or other artifacts of  honky culture. You'll get dirty on the trains so wear old clothes.  Don't pass up this great way to travel cause some bullshit western  scared you out of it.

CARS

If you know how to drive and want to travel long distances,  the auto transportation agencies are a good deal. Look in the  Yellow Pages under Automobile Transportation and Trucking or  Driveway. Rules vary, but normally you must be over 21 and have a  valid license. Call up and tell them when and where you want to go  and they will let you know if they have a car available. They give  you the car and a tank of gas free. You pay the rest. Go to pick up  the car alone, then get some people to ride along and help with the  driving and expenses. You can make New York to San Francisco for  about eighty dollars in tolls and gas in four days without pushing.  Usually you have the car for longer and can make a whole thing out  of it. You must look straight when you go to the agency. This can  be simply be done by wetting down your hair and shoving it under a  cap.

Another good way to travel cheaply is to find somebody who has  a car and is going your way. Usually underground newspapers list  people who either want rides or riders. Another excellent place to  find information is your local campus. Every campus has a bulletin  board for rides. Head shops and other community-minded stores have  notices up on the wall.

Gas

If you have a car and need some gas late at night you can get  a quart and then some by emptying the hoses from the pumps into  your tank. There is always a fair amount of surplus gas left when  the pumps are shut off.

If your traveling in a car and don't have enough money for gas  and tolls, stop at the bus station and see if anybody wants a lift.  If you find someone, explain your money situation and make a deal  with him. Hitch-hikers also can be asked to chip in on the gas.

You can carry a piece of tubing in the trunk of your car and  when the gas indicator gets low, pull up to a nice looking Cadillac  on some dark street and syphon off some of his gas. Just park your  car so the gas tank is next to the Caddy's, or use a large can.  Stick the hose into his tank, suck up enough to get things flowing,  and stick the other end into your tank. Having a lower level of  liquid, you tank will draw gas until you and the Caddy are equal.  "To each according to his need, from each according to his  ability," wrote Marx. Bet you hadn't realized until now that the  law of gravity affects economics.

Another way is to park in a service station over their filler  hole. Lift off one lid (like a small manhole cover), run down  twenty feet of rubber tubing thru the hole you've cut in your  floorboard, then turn on the electric pump which you have installed  to feed into your gas tank. All they ever see is a parked car. This  technique is especially rewarding when you have a bus.

BUSES

If you'd rather leave the driving and the paying to them, try  swiping a ride on the bus. Here's a method that has worked well.  Get a rough idea of where the bus has stopped before it arrived at  your station. If you are not at the beginning or final stop on the  route, wait until the bus you want pulls in and then out of the  station. Make like the bus just pulled off without you while you  went to the bathroom. If there is a station master, complain like  crazy to him. Tell him you're going to sue the company if your  luggage gets stolen. He'll put you on the next bus for free. If  there is no station master, lay your sad tale on the next driver  that comes along. If you know when the last bus left, just tell the  driver you've been stranded there for eight hours and you left your  kid sleeping on the other bus. Tell him you called ahead to the  company and they said to grab the next bus and they would take care  of it.

The next method isn't totally free but close enough. It's  called the hopper-bopper. Find a bus that makes a few stops before  it gets to where you want to go. The more stops with people getting  in our out the better. Buy a ticket for the short hop and stay on  the bus until you end up at your destination. You must develop a  whole style in order to pull this off because the driver has to  forget you are connected with the ticket you gave him. Dress  unobtrusively or make sure the driver hasn't seen your face.  Pretend to be asleep when the short hop station is reached. If you  get questioned, just act upset about sleeping through the stop you  "really" want and ask if it's possible to get a ride back.

AIRLINES

Up and away, junior outlaws! If you really want to get where  you're going in a hurry, don't forget skyjacker's paradise. Don't  forget the airlines. They make an unbelievable amount of bread on  their inflated prices, ruin the land with incredible amounts of  polluting wastes and noise, and deliberately hold back aviation  advances that would reduce prices and time of flight. We know two  foolproof methods to fly free, but unfortunately we feel publishing  them would cause the airlines to change their policy. The following  methods have been talked about enough, so the time seems right to  make them known to a larger circle of friends.

A word should be said right off about stolen tickets.  Literally millions of dollars worth of airline tickets are stolen  each year. If you have good underworld contacts, you can get a  ticket to anywhere you want at one-fourth the regular price. If you  are charged more, you are getting a slight rooking. In any case,  you can get a ticket for any flight or date and just trade it in.  They are actually as good as cash, except that it takes 30 days to  get a refund, and by then they might have traced the stolen  tickets. If you can get a stolen ticket, exchange or use it as soon  as possible, and always fly under a phony name. A stolen ticket for  a trip around the world currently goes for one hundred and fifty  dollars in New York.

One successful scheme requires access to the mailbox of a  person listed in the local phone book. Let's use the name Ron Davis  as an example. A woman calls one of the airlines with a very  efficient sounding rap such as: "Hello, this is Mr. Davis'  secretary at Allied Chemical. He and his wife would like to fly to  Chicago on Friday. Could you mail two first-class tickets to his  home and bill us here at Allied?" Every major corporation probably  has a Ron Davis, and the airlines rarely bother checking anyway.  Order your tickets two days before you wish to travel, and pick  them up at the mailbox or address you had them sent to. If you are  uptight in the airport about the tickets, just go up to another  airline and have the tickets exchanged.

One gutsy way to hitch a free ride is to board the plane  without a ticket. This is how it works. Locate the flight you want  and rummage through a wastebasket until you find an envelope for  that particular airline. Shuffle by the counter men (which is  fairly easy if it's busy). When the boarding call is made, stand in  line and get on the plane. Flash the empty envelope at the  stewardess as you board the plane. Carry a number of packages as a  decoy, so the stewardess won t ask you to open the envelope. If she  does, which is rare, and sees you have no ticket, act surprised.  "Oh my gosh, it must have fallen out in the wash room," will do  fine. Run back down the ramp as if you're going to retrieve the  ticket. Disappear and try later on a different airline. Nine out of  ten revolutionaries say it's the only way to fly. This trick works  only on airlines that don't use the boarding pass system.

If you want to be covered completely, use the hopper-bopper  method described in the section on Buses, with this added security  precaution. Buy two tickets from different cashiers, or better  still, one from an agent in town. Both will be on the same flight.  Only one ticket will be under a phony name and for the short hop,  white the ticket under your real name will be for your actual  destination. At the boarding counter, present the short hop ticket.  You will be given an envelope with a white receipt in it. Actually,  the white receipt is the last leaf in your ticket. Once you are  securely seated and aloft, take out the ticket with your name and  final destination. Gently peel away everything but the white  receipt. Place the still valid ticket back in your pocket. Now  remove from the envelope and destroy the short hop receipt. In its  place, put the receipt for the ticket you have in your pocket.

When you land at the short hop airport, stay on the plane.  Usually the stewardesses just ask you if you are remaining on the  flight. If you have to, you can actually show her your authentic  receipt. When you get to your destination, you merely put the  receipt back on the bonafide ticket that you still have in your  pocket. It isn't necessary that they be glued together. Present the  ticket for a refund or exchange it for another ticket. This method  works well even in foreign countries. You can actually fly around  the world for $88.00 using the hopper-bopper method and switching  receipts.

If you can't hack these shucks you should at least get a Youth  Card and travel for half fare. If you are over twenty-two but still  in your twenties, you can easily pass. Get a card from a friend who  has similar color hair and eyes. Your friend can easily get one  from another airline. You can master your friend's signature and  get a supporting piece of identification from him to back up your  youth card if you find it necessary. If you have a friend who works  for an airline or travel agency, just get a card under your own  name and an age below the limit. Your friend can validate the card.  Flying youth fare is on stand-by, so it's always a good idea to  call ahead and book a number of reservations under fictitious names  on the flight you'll be taking. This will fuck up the booking of  regular passengers and insure you a seat.

By the way, if you fly cross-country a number of times, swipe  one of the plug-in head sets. Always remember to pack it in your  traveling bag. This way you'll save a two dollar fee charged for  the in-flight movie. The headsets are interchangeable on all  airlines.

One way to fly free is to actually hitch a ride. Look for the  private plane area located at every airport, usually in some remote  part of the field. You can find it by noticing where the small  planes without airline markings take off and land. Go over to the  runways and ask around. Often the mechanics will let you know when  someone is leaving for your destination and point out a pilot. Tell  him you lost your ticket and have to get back to school. Single  pilots often like to have a passenger along and it's a real gas  flying in a small plane.

Some foreign countries have special arrangements for free air  travel to visiting writers, artists or reporters. Brazil and  Argentina are two we know of for sure. Call or write the embassy of  the country you wish to visit in Washington or their mission to the  United Nations in New York. Writing works best, especially if you  can cop some stationery from a newspaper or publishing house. Tell  them you will be writing a feature story for some magazine on the  tourist spots or handcrafts of the country. The embassy will  arrange for you to travel gratis aboard one of their air force  planes. The planes leave only from Washington and New York at  unscheduled times. Once you have the O.K. letter from the embassy  you're all set. This is definitely worth checking out if you want  to vacation in a foreign country with all sorts of free bonuses  thrown in.

A one-way ride is easy if you want to get into skyjacking.  Keep the piece or knife in your shoe to avoid possible detection  with the "metal scanner," a long black tube that acts like a geiger  counter. Or use a plastic knife or bomb. It's also advisable to  wrap your dope in a non-metallic material. Avoid tinfoil.

The crews have instructions to take you wherever you want to  go even if they have to refuel, but watch out for air marshals. To  avoid air marshals and searches pick an airline which flies short  domestic hops. You should plan to end up in a country hostile to  the United States or you'll end up right back where you came from  in some sturdy handcuffs. One dude wanted to travel in style so he  demanded $100,000 as a going-away gift. The airlines quickly paid  off. The guy then got greedy and demanded a hundred million  dollars. When he returned to pick up the extra pocket money, he got  nabbed. None the less, skyjacking appears to be the cheapest,  fastest way to get away from it all.

IN CITY TRAVEL

Any of the public means of transportation can be ripped off  easily. Get on the bus with a large bill and present it after the  bus has left the stop. If the bus is crowded, slip in the back door  when it opens to dispatch passengers.

Two people can easily get through the turnstile in a subway on  one token by doubling up. In some subway systems cards are given  out to high school kids or senior citizens or employees of the  city. The next time you are in a subway station notice people  flashing cards to the man in the booth and entering through the  "exit" door. Notice the color of the card used by people in your  age group. Get a piece of colored paper in a stationery store or  find some card of the same color you need. Put this "card" in a  plastic window of your wallet and flash it in the same way those  with a bona fide pass do.

Before entering a turnstile, always test the swing bar. If  someone during the day put in an extra token, it's still in the  machine waiting for you to enter free.

For every token and coin deposited in an automatic turnstile,  there is a foreign coin the same size for much less that will work  in the machine. (See the Yippie Currency Exchange, following, for  more info.) Buy a cheap bag of assorted foreign coins from a dealer  that you can locate in the Yellow Pages. Size up the coins with a  token from your subway system. You can get any of these coins in  bulk from a large dealer. Generally they are about l,000 for five  dollars. Tell him you make jewelry out of them if he gets  suspicious. Giving what almost amounts to free subway rides away is  a communal act of love. The best outlaws in the world rip-off shit  for a lot more people than just themselves. Robin Hood lives!

FREE LAND

Despite what you may have heard, there is still some rural  land left in Amerika. The only really free land is available in  Alaska and remote barren areas of the western states. The latest  information in this area is found in a periodic publication called  Our Public Lands, available from the Superintendent of Documents,  Washington, D.C. 20402. It costs $1.00 for a subscription. Also  contact the U.S. Department of the Interior, Bureau of Land  Management, Washington, D.C. 20240 and ask for information on  "homesteading." By the time this book is out though, the Secretary  of the Interior's friends in the oil companies might have stolen  all the available free land. Being an oil company is about the  easiest way to steal millions. Never call it stealing though,  always refer to it as "research and development."

Continental United States has no good free land that we know  of, but there are some very low prices in areas suited for country  communities. Write to School of Living, Freeland, Maryland, for  their newspaper Green Revolution with the latest information in  this area. Canada has free land available, and the Canadian  government will send you a free list if you write to the Department  of Land and Forests, Parliament Building, Quebec City, Canada. Also  write to the Geographical Branch, Department of Mines and Technical  Surveys, Parliament Building, Quebec City, Canada. Correspondence  can be carried out with the Communications Group, 2630 Point Grey  Road, Vancouver 8, British Columbia, Canada, for advice on  establishing a community in Canada. The islands off the coast of  British Columbia, its western region and the area along the  Kootenai River are among the best locations.

If you just want to rip off some land, there are two ways to  do it; openly or secretly. If you are going to do it out front,  look around for a piece of land that's in dispute, which has its  sovereignty in question-islands and deltas between the U.S. and  Canada, or between the U.S. and Mexico, or any number of other  borderline lands. You might even consider one of the abandoned  oil-drilling platforms, which are fair game under high seas salvage  laws. The possibilities are endless.

If you intend to do it quietly, you will want a completely  different type of location. Find a rugged area with lots of elbow  room and plenty of places to hide, like the Rocky Mountains,  Florida swamps, Death Valley, or New York City. Put together a  tight band of guerrillas and do your thing. With luck you will last  forever.

If you just want to camp out or try some hermit living in the  plushest surroundings available, you'll do best to head for one of  the national parks. Since the parks are federal property, there's  very little the local fuzz can do about you, and the forest rangers  are generally the live-and-let-live types, although there have been  increasing reports of long-hairs being vamped on by Smokey the Pig,  as in Yosemite. You can get a complete list from National Park  Service, Department of the Interior, Washington, D.C. 20240. The  following is a list of some good ones:

*This summer Yosemite forest rangers tried to evict a group of  Yippies from their encampment. The Yippies rioted in the valley,  spooked the tourists, burned cars and fought for their right to  stay.

Earth People's Park is an endeavor to purchase land and allow  people to come and live for free. They function as a clearing house  for people that want to donate land and those who wish to settle.  They own 600 acres in northern Vermont and are trying to raise  money to buy more. Write to Earth People's Park, P.0. Box 313,  1230 Grant Ave., San Francisco, California 94133.

People's Parks are sprouting up all over as people reclaim the  land being ripped off by universities, factories, and corrupt city  planning agencies. The model is the People's Park struggle in  Berkeley during the spring of 1969. The people fought to defend a  barren parking lot they had turned into a community center with  grass, swings, free-form sculpture and gardens. The University of  California, with the aid of Ronald Reagan and the Berkeley storm  troopers, fought with guns, clubs and tear gas to regain the land  from the outlaw people. The pigs killed James Rector and won an  empty victory. For now the park is fenced off, tarred over and  converted into unused basketball courts and unused parking lots.  Not one person has violated the oath never to set foot on the site.  It stands, cold and empty, two blocks north of crowded Telegraph  Avenue. If the revolution does not survive, all the land will  perish under the steam roller of imperialism. People's Death Valley  will happen in our lifetime.

FREE HOUSING

If you are in a city without a place to stay, ask the first  group of hip-looking folks where you can crash. You might try the  office of the local underground newspaper. In any hip community,  the underground newspaper is generally the source of the best  up-to-the-moment information. But remember that they are very busy,  and don't impose on them. Many churches now have runaway houses. If  you are under sixteen and can hack some bullshit jive about  "adjusting," "opening a dialogue," and "things aren't that bad,"  then these are the best deals for free room and board. Check out  the ground rules first, i.e., length of stay allowed, if they  inform your parents or police, facilities and services available.  Almost always they can be accepted at their word, which is  something very sacred to missionaries. If they became known as  double-crossers, the programs would be finished.

Some hip communities have crash pads set up, but these rarely  last more than a few months. To give out the addresses we have  would be quite impractical. We have never run across a crash pad  that lasted more than a month or so. If in a cit, try hustling a  room at a college dorm. This is especially good in summer or on  week-ends. If you have a sleeping bag, the parks are always good,  as is "tar jungle" or sleeping on the roofs of tall buildings.  Local folks will give you some good advice on what to watch out for  and information on vagrancy laws which might help you avoid getting  busted.

For more permanent needs, squatting is not only free, it's a  revolutionary act. If you stay quiet you can stay indefinitely. If  you have community support you may last forever.

COMMUNES

In the city or in the country, communes can be a cheap and  enjoyable way of living. Although urban and rural communes face  different physical environments, they share common group problems.  The most important element in communal living is the people, for  the commune will only make it if everyone is fairly compatible. A  nucleus of 4 to 7 people is best and it is necessary that no member  feels extremely hostile to any other member when the commune gets  started. The idea that things will work out later is pig swill.  More communes have busted up over incompatibility than any other  single factor. People of similar interests and political  philosophies should live together. One speed freak can wreck almost  any group. There are just too many day-to-day hassles involved  living in a commune to not start off compatible in as many ways as  possible. The ideal arrangement is for the people to have known  each other before they move in together.

Once you have made the opening moves, evening meetings will  occasionally be necessary to divide up the responsibilities and  work out the unique problems of a communal family. Basically, there  are two areas that have to be pretty well agreed upon if the  commune is to survive. People's attitudes toward Politics, Sex,  Drugs and Decision-making have to be in fairly close agreement.  Then the even most important decisions about raising the rent,  cleaning, cooking and maintenance will have to be made. Ground  rules for inviting non-members should be worked out before the  first time it happens, as this is a common cause for friction.  Another increasingly important issue involves defense. Communes  have continually been targets of attack by the more Neanderthal  elements of the surrounding community. In Minneapolis for example,  "headhunts" as they are called are commonplace. You should have  full knowledge of the local gun laws and a collective defense  should be worked out.

Physical attacks are just one way of making war on communes  and, hence, our Free Nation. Laws, cops, and courts are there to  protect the power and the property of those that already got the  shit. Police harassment, strict enforcement of health codes and  fire regulations and the specially designed anti-commune laws being  passed by town elders, should all be known and understood by the  members of a commune before they even buy or rent property. On all  these matters, you should seek out experienced members of communes  already established in the vicinity you wish to settle. Work out  mutual defense arrangements with nearby families-both legal and  extralegal. Remember, not only do you have the right to  self-defense, but it is your duty to our new Nation to erase the  "Easy-Rider-take-any-shit" image which invites attack. Let them  know you are willing to defend your way of living and your chances  of survival will increase.

URBAN LIVING

If you're headed for city living, the first thing you'll have  to do is locate an apartment or loft, an increasingly difficult  task. At certain times of the year, notably June and September, the  competition is fierce because of students leaving or entering  school. If you can avoid these two months, you'll have a better  selection. A knowledge of your plans in advance can aid a great  deal in finding an apartment, for the area can be scouted before  you move in. Often, if you know of people leaving a desirable  apartment, you can make arrangements with the landlord, and a  deposit will hold the place. If you let them know you're willing to  buy their furniture, people will be more willing to give you  information about when they plan to move. Watch out for getting  screwed on exorbitant furniture swindles by the previous tenants  and excessive demands on the part of the landlords. In most cities,  the landlord is not legally allowed to ask for more than one  month's rent as security. Often the monthly rent itself is  regulated by a city agency. A little checking on the local laws and  a visit to the housing agency might prove well worth it.

Don't go to a rental agency unless you are willing to pay an  extra month's rent as a fee. Wanted ads in newspapers and bulletin  boards located in community centers and supermarkets have some  leads. Large universities have a service for finding good  apartments for administrators, faculty and students, in that order.  Call the university, say you have just been appointed to  such-and-such position and you need housing in the area. They will  want to know all your requirements and rent limitations, but often  they have very good deals available, especially if you've appointed  yourself to a high enough position.

Aside from these, the best way is to scout a desired area and  inquire about future apartments. Often landlords or rental agencies  have control over a number of buildings in a given area. You can  generally find a nameplate inside the hall of the building. Calling  them directly will let you know of any apartments available.

When you get an apartment, furnishing will be the next step.  You can double your sleeping space by building bunk beds. Nail two  by fours securely from ceiling to floor, about three feet from the  walls, where the beds are desired. Then build a frame out of two by  fours at a convenient height. Make sure you use nails or screws  strong enough to support the weight of people sleeping or balling.  Nail a sheet of 3/4 inch plywood on the frame. Mattresses and  almost all furniture needed for your pal can be gotten free (see  section on Free Furniture). Silverware can be copped at any  self-service restaurant.

RURAL LIVING

If you are considering moving to the country, especially as a  group, you are talking about farms and farmland. There are some  farms for rent, and occasionally a family that has to be away for a  year or two will let you live on their farm if you keep the place  in repair. These can be found advertised in the back of various  farming magazines and in the classified sections of newspapers,  especially the Sunday editions. Generally speaking, however, if  you're interested in a farm, you should be considering an outright  purchase.

First, you have to determine in what part of the country you  want to live in terms of the climate you prefer and how far away  from the major cities you wish to locate. The least populated  states, such as Utah, Idaho, the Dakotas, Montana and the like,  have the cheapest prices and the lowest tax rates. The more  populated a state, and in turn, the closer to a city, the higher  the commercial value of the land.

There are hundreds of different types of farms, so the next  set of questions you'll have to raise concerns the type of farm  activity you'll want to engage in. Cattle farms are different than  vegetable farms or orchards. Farms come in sizes: from half an acre  to ranches larger than the state of Connecticut. They will run in  price from $30 to $3000 an acre, with the most expensive being  prime farmland in fertile river valleys located close to an urban  area. The further away from the city and the further up a hill, the  cheaper the land gets. It also gets woodier, rockier and steeper,  which means less tillable land.

If you are talking of living in a farm house and maybe having  a small garden and some livestock for your own use, with perhaps a  pond on the property, you are looking for what is called a  recreational farm. When you buy a recreational farm, naturally you  are interested in the house, barn, well, fences, chicken-coop,  corrals, woodsheds and other physical structures on the property.  Unless these are in unusually good condition or unique, they do not  enter into the sale price as major factors. It is the land itself  that is bought and sold.

Farmland is measured in acreage; an acre being slightly more  than 43,560 square feet. The total area is measured in 40-acre  plots. Thus, if a farmer or a real estate agent says he has a plot  of land down the road, he means a 40-acre farm. Farms are generally  measured this way, with an average recreational farm being 160  acres in size or an area covering about 1/2 square mile. A  reasonable rate for recreational farmland 100 miles from a major  city with good water and a livable house would be about $50 per  acre. For a 160-acre farm, it would be $8,000, which is not an  awful lot considering what you are getting. For an overall view,  get the free catalogues and brochures provided by the United Farm  Agency, 612 W. 47th St., Kansas City, Mo. 64112.

Now that you have a rough idea of where and what type of farm  you want, you can begin to get more specific. Check out the  classified section in the Sunday newspaper of the largest city near  your desired location. Get the phone book and call or write to real  estate agencies in the vicinity. Unlike the city, where there is a  sellers' market, rural estate agents collect their fee from the  seller of the property, so you won't have to worry about the  agent's fee.

When you have narrowed down the choices, the next thing you'll  want to look at is the plot book for the county. The plot book has  all the farms in each township mapped out. lt also shows terrain  variations, type of housing on the land, location of rivers, roads  and a host of other pertinent information. Road accessibility,  especially in the winter, is an important factor. If the farms  bordering the one you have selected are abandoned or not in full  use, then for all intents and purposes, you have more land than you  are buying.

After doing all this, you are prepared to go look at the farm  itself. Notice the condition of the auxiliary roads leading to the  house. You'll want an idea of what sections of the land are  tillable. Make note of how many boulders you'll have to clear to do  some planting. Also note how many trees there are and to what  extent the brush has to be cut down. Be sure and have a good idea  of the insect problems you can expect. Mosquitoes or flies can bug  the shit out of you. Feel the soil where you plan to have a garden  and see how rich it is. If there are fruit trees, check their  condition. Taste the water. Find out if hunters or tourists come  through the land. Examine the house. The most important things are  the basement and the roof. In the basement examine the beams for  dry rot and termites. See how long it will be before the roof must  be replaced. Next check the heating system, the electrical wiring  and the plumbing. Then you'll want to know about services such as  schools, snow plowing, telephones, fire department and finally  about your neighbors. If the house is beyond repair, you might  still want the farm, especially if you are good at carpentry.  Cabins, A-Frames, domes and tepees are all cheaply constructed with  little experience. Get the materials from your nearest military  installation.

Finally, check out the secondary structures on the land to see  how usable they are. If there is a pond, you'll want to see how  deep it is for swimming. If there are streams, you'll want to know  about the fishing possibilities; and if large wooded areas, the  hunting.

In negotiating the final sales agreement, you should employ a  lawyer. You'll also want to check out the possibility of  negotiating a bank loan for the farm. Don't forget that you have to  pay taxes on the land, so inquire from the previous owner or agent  as to the tax bill. Usually, you can count on paying about $50  annually per 40-acre plot.

Finally, check out the federal programs available in the area.  If you can learn the ins and outs of the government programs, you  can rip off plenty. The Feed-Grain Program of the Department of  Agriculture pays you not to grow grain. The Cotton Subsidy Program  pays you not to grow cotton. Also look into the Soil Bank Program  of the United States Development Association and various Department  of Forestry programs which pay you to plant trees. Between not  planting cotton and planting trees, you should be able to manage.

FREE EDUCATION

Usually when you ask somebody in college why they are there,  they'll tell you it's to get an education. The truth of it is, they  are there to get the degree so that they can get ahead in the rat  race. Too many college radicals are two-timing punks. The only  reason you should be in college is to destroy it. If there is stuff  that you want to learn though, there is a way to get a college  education absolutely free. Simply send away for the schedule of  courses at the college of your choice. Make up the schedule you  want and audit the classes. In smaller classes this might be a  problem, but even then, if, the teacher is worth anything at all,  he'll let you stay. In large classes, no one will ever object.

If you need books for a course, write to the publisher  claiming you are a lecturer at some school and considering using  their book in your course. They will always send you free books.

There are Free Universities springing up all over our new  Nation. Anybody can teach any course. People sign up for the  courses and sometimes pay a token registration fee. This money is  used to publish a catalogue and pay the rent. If you're on welfare  you don't have to pay. You can take as many or as few courses as  you want. Classes are held everywhere: in the instructor's house,  in the park, on the beach, at one of the student's houses or in  liberated buildings. Free Universities offer courses ranging from  Astrology to the Use of Firearms. The teaching is usually of  excellent quality and you'll learn in a community-type atmosphere.

7. FREE MEDICAL CARE

Due to the efforts of the Medical Committee for Human Rights,  the Student Health Organization and other progressive elements  among younger doctors and nurses. Free People's Clinics have been  happening in every major city. They usually operate out of store  fronts and are staffed with volunteer help. An average clinic can  handle fifty patients a day.

If you've had an accident or have an acute illness, even a bad  cold, check into the emergency room of any hospital. Given them a  sob story complete with phony name and address. After treatment  they present you with a slip and direct you to the cashier. Just  walk on by, as the song suggests. A good decoy is to ask for the  washroom. After waiting there a few moments, split. If you're  caught sneaking out, tell them you ran out of the house without  your wallet. Ask them to bill you at your phony address. This  billing procedure works in both hospital emergency rooms and  clinics. You can keep going back for repeated visits up to three  months before the cashier's office tells the doctor about your  fractured payments.

You can get speedy medical advice and avoid emergency room  delays by calling the hospital, asking for the emergency unit and  speaking directly to the doctor over the phone. Older doctors frown  on this procedure since they cannot extort their usual exorbitant  fee over the phone. Younger ones generally do not share this  hang-up.

Cities usually have free clinics for a variety of special  ailments. Tuberculosis Clinics, Venereal Disease Clinics, and Free  Shot Clinics (yellow fever, polio, tetanus, etc.) are some of the  more common. A directory of these clinics and other free health  services the local community provides can be obtained by writing  your Chamber of Commerce or local Health Department.

Most universities have clinics connected with their dental,  optometry or other specialized medical schools. If not for free,  then certainly for very low rates, you can get dental work  repaired, eyeglasses fitted and treatment of other specific health  needs.

Free psychiatric treatment can often be gotten at the  out-patient department of any mental hospital. Admission into these  hospitals is free, but a real bummer. Use them as a last resort  only. Some cities have a suicide prevention center and if you are  desperate and need help, call them. Your best choice in a  psychiatric emergency is to go to a large general hospital, find  the emergency unit and ask to see the psychiatrist on duty.

BIRTH CONTROL CLINICS

Planned Parenthood and the Family Planning Association staff  numerous free birth control clinics throughout the country. They  provide such services as sex education, examinations, Pap smear and  birth control information and devices. The devices include pills, a  diaphragm, or IUD (intra-uterine device) which they will insert. If  you are unmarried and under 18, you might have to talk to a social  worker, but it's no sweat because anybody gets contraceptive  devices that wants them. Call up and ask them to send you their  booklets on the different methods of birth control available.

If you would rather go to a private doctor, try to find out  from a friend the name of a hip gynecologist, who is sympathetic to  the fact that you're low on bread. Otherwise one visit could cost  $25.00 or more.

Before deciding on a contraceptive, you should be hip to some  general information. There has been much research on the pill, and  during the past 10 years it has proven its effectiveness, if not is  safety. The two most famous name brands are Ortho-Novum and Envoid.  They all require a doctor's prescription. Different type pills are  accompanied by slightly different instructions, so read the  directions carefully. In many women, the pills produce side effects  such as weight increase, dizziness or nausea. Sometimes the pill  affects your vision and more often your mood. Some women with  specialized blood diseases are advised not to use them, but in  general, women have little or no trouble. Different brand names  have different hormonal balances (progesterone-estrogen). If you  get uncomfortable side effects, insist that your doctor switch your  brand. If you stop the pill method for any reason and don't want to  get pregnant, be very careful to use another means right away.

Another contraceptive device becoming more popular is the IUD,  or the loop. It is a small plastic or stainless steel  irregularly-shaped spring that the doctor inserts inside the  opening of the uterus. The insertion is not without pain, but it's  safe if done by a physician, and it's second only to the pill in  prevention of pregnancy. Once it's in place, you can forget about  it for a few years or until you wish to get pregnant. Doctors are  reluctant to prescribe them for women who have not borne children  or had an abortion, because of the intense pain that accompanies  insertion. But if you can stand the pain associated with three to  four uterine contractions, you should push the doctor for this  method. Inserting it during the last day of your period will make  it easier.

The diaphragm is a round piece of flexible rubber about 2  inches in diameter with a hard rubber rim on the outside. It used  to be inserted just before the sex act, but hip doctors now  recommend that it be worn continuously and taken out every few days  for washing and also during the menstrual period. It is most  effective when used with a sperm-killing jelly or cream. A doctor  will fit you for a proper size diaphragm.

The next best method is the foams that you insert twenty  minutes before fucking. The best foams available are Delfen and  Emko. They have the advantage of being nonprescription items so you  can rush into any drug store and pick up a dispenser when the  spirit moves you. Follow the directions carefully. Unfortunately,  these foams taste terrible and are not available in flavors. It  just shows you how far science has to go.

Another device is the prophylactic, or rubber as it is called.  This is the only device available to men. It is a thin rubber  sheath that fits over the penis. Because they are subject to  breaking and sliding off, their effectiveness is not super great.  If you are forced to use them, the best available are lubricated  sheepskins with a reservoir tip.

The rhythm method or Vatican roulette as it is called by hip  Catholics, is a waste unless you are ready to surround yourself  with thermometers, graphs and charts. You also have to limit your  fucking to prescribed days. Even with all these precautions, women  have often gotten pregnant using the rhythm method.

The oldest and least effective method is simply for the male  to pull out just before he comes. There are billions of sperm cells  in each ejaculation and only one is needed to fertilize the woman's  egg and cause a pregnancy. Most of the sperm is in the first  squirt, so you had better be quick if you employ this technique.

If the woman misses her period she shouldn't panic. It might  be delayed because of emotional reasons. Just wait two weeks before  going to a doctor or clinic for a pregnancy test. When you go, be  sure to bring your first morning urine specimen.

ABORTIONS

The best way to find out about abortions is to contact your  local woman's liberation organization through your underground  newspaper or radio station. Some Family Planning Clinics and even  some liberal churches set up abortions, but these might run as high  as $700. Underground newspapers often have ads that read "Any girl  in trouble call - -," or something similar. The usual rate for an  abortion is about $500 and it's awful hard to bargain when you need  one badly. Only go to a physician who is practicing or might have  just lost his license. Forget the stereotype image of these doctors  as they are performing a vital service. Friends who have had an  abortion can usually recommend a good doctor and fill you in on  what's going to happen.

Abortions are very minor operations if done correctly. They  can be done almost any time, but after three months, it's no longer  so casual and more surgical skill is required. Start making plans  as soon as you find out. The sooner the better, in terms of the  operation.

Get a pregnancy test at a clinic. If it is positive and you  want an abortion, start that day to make plans. If you get negative  results from the test and still miss your period, have a  gynecologist perform an examination if you are still worried.

If you cannot arrange an abortion through woman's liberation,  Family Planning, a sympathetic clergyman or a friend who has had  one, search out a liberal hospital and talk to one of their social  workers. Almost all hospitals perform "therapeutic" abortions. Tell  a sob story about the desertion of your boy friend or that you take  LSD every day or that defects run in your family. Act mentally  disturbed. If you qualify, you can get an abortion that will be  free under Medicaid or other welfare medical plans. The safest form  of abortion is the vacuum-curettage method, but not all doctors are  hip to it. It is safer and quicker with less chance of  complications than the old-fashioned scrape method.

Many states have recently passed liberalized abortion laws,  such as New York* (by far the most extensive), Hawaii and Maryland,  due to the continuing pressure of radical women. The battle for  abortion and certainly for free abortion is far from over even in  the states with liberal laws. They are far too expensive for the  ten to twenty minute minor operation involved and the red tape is  horrendous. Free abortions must be look-on as a fundamental right,  not a sneaky, messy trauma.

*There is a residence requirement for New York but using a friend's  New York address at the hospital will be good enough. The procedure  takes only a few days and costs between $200 and $500, depending on  the place. The best advice is to call one of the New York Abortion  Referral Services or Birth Control Groups listed in the New York  Directory section.

DISEASES TREATED FREE

Syph and Clap (syphilis and gonorrhea) are two diseases that  they are easy to pick up. They come from balling. Anyone who claims  they got it from sitting on a toilet seat must have a fondness for  weird positions.

Both men and women are subject to the diseases. Using a  prophylactic usually will prevent the spreading of venereal  disease, but you should really seek to have it cured. Syphilis  usually begins with an infection which may look like a cold sore or  pimple around the sex organ. There is no pain associated with the  lesions. Soon the sore disappears even without treatment. This is  often followed by a period of rashes on the body (especially the  palms of the hands) and inflammation of the mouth and throat. These  symptoms also disappear without treatment. It must be understood,  however, that even if these symptoms disappear, the disease still  remains if left untreated. It can cause serious trouble such as  heart disease, blindness, insanity and paralysis. Also, it can fuck  up any kids you might produce and is easily passed on to anyone you  ball.

Gonorrhea (clap) is more common than syphilis. Its first signs  are a discharge from your sex organ that is painful. Like syphilis,  it affects both men and women, but is often unnoticed in women.  There is usually itching and burning associated with the affected  area. It can leave you sterile if left untreated.

Both these venereal diseases can be treated in a short time  with attention. Avail yourself of the free V.D. clinics in every  town. Follow the doctor's instructions to the letter and try to let  the other people you've had sexual contact with know you had VD.

There are other fungus diseases that resemble syphilis or  gonorrhea, but are relatively harmless. Check out every infection  in your crotch area, especially those with open sores or an unusual  discharge and you'll be safe.

Crabs are not harmful, but they can make you scratch your  crotch for hours on end. They are also highly transmittable by  balling. Actually they are a form of body lice and easy to cure. Go  to your local druggist and ask him for the best remedy available.  He'll give you one of several lotions and instructions for proper  use. We recommend Kwell.

A common disease in the hip community is hepatitis. There are  two kinds. One you get from sticking dirty needles in your arm  (serum hepatitis) and the other more common strain from eating  infected food or having intimate contact with an infected carrier  (infectious hepatitis). The symptoms for both are identical;  yellowish skin and eyes, dark piss and light crap, loss of appetite  and total listlessness. Hep is a very dangerous disease that can  cause a number of permanent conditions, including death, which is  extremely permanent. It should be treated by a doctor, often in a  hospital.

FREE COMMUNICATION

If you don't like the news, why not go out and make your own?  Creating free media depends to a large extent on your imagination  and ability to follow through on ideas. The average Amerikan is  exposed to over 1,600 commercials each day. Billboards, glossy ads  and television spots make up much of the word environment they live  in. To crack through the word mush means creating new forms of free  communication. Advertisements for revolution are important in  helping to educate and mold the milieu of people you wish to win  over.

Guerrilla theater events are always good news items and if  done right, people will remember them forever. Throwing out money  at the Stock Exchange or dumping soot on executives at Con Edison  or blowing up the policeman statue in Chicago immediately conveys  an easily understood message by using the technique of creative  disruption. Recently to dramatize the illegal invasion of Cambodia,  400 Yippies stormed across the Canadian border in an invasion of  the United States. They threw paint on store windows and physically  attacked residents of Blair, Washington. A group of Vietnam  veterans marched in battle gear from Trenton to Valley Forge. Along  the way they performed mock attacks on civilians the way they were  trained to do in Southeast Asia.

Dying all the outdoor fountains red and then sending a message  to the newspaper explaining why you did it, dramatizes the idea  that blood is being shed needlessly in imperialist wars. A special  metallic bonding glue available from Eastman-Kodak will form a  permanent bond in only 45 seconds. Gluing up locks of all the  office buildings in your town is a great way to dramatize the fact  that our brothers and sisters are being jailed all the time. Then,  of course, there are always explosives which dramatically make your  point and then some.

PRESS CONFERENCES

Another way of using the news to advertise the revolution and  make propaganda is to call a press, conference. Get an appropriate  place that has some relationship to the content of your message.  Send out announcements to as many members of the press as you can.  If you do not have a press list, you can make one up by looking  through the Yellow Pages under Newspapers, Radio Stations,  Television Stations, Magazines and Wire Services. Check out your  list with other groups and pick up names of reporters who attend  movement press conferences. Address a special invitation to them as  well as one to their newspaper. Address the announcements to "City  Desk" or "'News Department." Schedule the press conference for  about 11:00 A.M. as this allows the reporters to file the story in  time for the evening newscast or papers. On the day of the  scheduled conference, call the important city desks or reporters  about 9:00 A.M. and remind them to come.

Everything about a successful press conference must be  dramatic, from the announcements and phone calls to the statements  themselves. Nothing creates a worse image than four or five men in  business suits sitting behind a table and talking in a calm manner  at a fashionable hotel. Constantly seek to have every detail of the  press conference differ in style as well as content from the  conferences of people in power. Make use of music and visual  effects. Don't stiffen up before the press. Make the statement as  short and to the point as possible. Don't read from notes, look  directly into the camera. The usual television spot is one minute  and twenty seconds. The cameras start buzzing on your opening  statement and often run out of film before you finish. So make it  brief and action packed. The question period should be even more  dramatic. Use the questioner's first name when answering a  question. This adds an air of informality and networks are more apt  to use an answer directed personally to one of their newsmen.  Express your emotional feelings. Be funny, get angry, be sad or  ecstatic. If you cannot convey that you are deeply excited or  troubled or outraged about what you are saying, how do you expect  it of others who are watching a little image box in their living  room? Remember, you are advertising a new way of life to people.  Watch TV commercials. See how they are able to convey everything  they need to be effective in such a short time and limited space.  At the same tune you're mocking the shit they are pushing, steal  their techniques.

At rock concerts, during intermission or at the end of the  performance, fight your way to the stage.

COMMUNICATION

Announce that if the electricity is cut off the walls will be  torn down. This galvanizes the audience and makes the owners of the  hall the villains if they fuck around. Lay out a short exciting rap  on what's coming down. Focus on a call around one action. Sometimes  it might be good to engage rock groups in dialogues about their  commitment to the revolution. Interrupting the concert is frowned  upon since it is only spitting in the faces of the people you are  trying to reach. Use the Culture as ocean to swim in. Treat it with  care.

Sandwich boards and hand-carried signs are effective  advertisements. You can stand on a busy corner and hold up a sign  saying "Apartment Needed," "Free Angela," "Smash the State" or  other slogans. They can be written on dollar bills, envelopes that  are being mailed and other items that are passed from person to  person.

Take a flashlight with a large face to movie theaters and  other dark public gathering places. Cut the word "STRIKE" or  "REVOLT" or "YIPPIE" out of dark cellophane. Paste the stencil over  the flashlight, thus allowing you to project the word on a distant  wall.

There are a number of all night call-in shows that have  a  huge audience. If you call with what the moderator considers  "exciting controversy," he may give you a special number so you  won't have to compete in the switchboard roller-derby. It often can  take hours before you get through to these shows. Here's a trick  that will help you out if the switchboard is jammed. The call-in  shows have a series of hones so that when one is busy the next will  take the call. Usually the numbers run in sequence. Say a station  gives out PL 5-8640, as the number to call. That means it also uses  PL 5-8641, PL 5-8642 and so on. If you get a busy signal, hang up  and try calling PL S-8647 say.	This trick works in a variety of  situations where you want to get a call through a busy switchboard.  Remember it for airline and bus information.

WALL PAINTING

One of the best forms of free communication is painting  messages on a blank wall. The message must be short and bold. You  want to be able to paint it on before the pigs come and yet have it  large enough so that people can see it at a distance. Cans of spray  paint that you can pick up at any hardware store work best. Pick  spots that have lot of traffic. Exclamation points are good for  emphasis. If you are writing the same message, make a stencil. You  can make a stencil that says WAR and spray it on with white paint  under the word "STOP" on stop signs. You can stencil a five-pointed  star and using yellow paint, spray it on the dividing line between  the red and blue on all post office boxes. This simulates the flag  of the National Liberation Front of Vietnam. You can stencil a  marijuana leaf and using green paint, spray it over cigarette and  whisky billboards on buses and subways. The women's liberation sign  with red paint is good for sexist ads.	Sometimes you will wish to  exhibit great daring in your choice of locations. When the  Vietnamese hero Nguyen Van Troi was executed, the Viet Cong put up  a poster the next day on the exact spot inside the highest security  prison in the country.

Wall postering allows you to get more information before the  public than a quickly scribbled slogan. Make sure the surface is  smooth or finely porous. Smear the back of the poster with  condensed milk, spread on with a brush, sponge, rag or your hands.  Condensed milk dries very fast and hard. Also smear some on the  front once the poster is up to give protection against the weather  and busy fingers that like to pull at corners. Wallpaper pastes  also work quickly and efficiently. It's best to work both painting  and postering at night with a look-out. This way you can work the  best spots without being harassed by the pig patrol, which is  usually unappreciative of Great Art.

USE OF THE FLAG

The generally agreed upon flag of our nation is black with a  red, five pointed star behind a green marijuana leaf in the center.  It is used by groups that understand the correct use of culture and  symbolism in a revolutionary struggle. When displayed, it  immediately increases the feelings of solidarity between our  brothers and sisters. High school kids have had great fights over  which flag to salute in school. A sign of any liberated zone is the  flag being flown. Rock concerts and festivals have their generally  apolitical character instantly changed when the flag is displayed.  The political theoreticians who do not recognize the flag and the  importance of the culture it represents are ostriches who are  ignorant of basic human nature. Throughout history people have  fought for religion, life-style, land, a flag (nation), because  they were ordered to, for fortune, because they were attacked or  for the hell of it. If you don't think the flag is important, ask  the hardhats.

RADIO

Want to construct your own neighborhood radio station? You can  get a carrier-current transmitter designed by a group of brothers  and sisters called Radio Free People. No FCC license is required  for the range is less than 1/2 mile. The small transistorized units  plug into any wall outlet. Write Radio Free People, 133 Mercer St.,  New York, New York 10012 for more details. For further information  see the chapter on Guerrilla Broadcasting later in the book.

FREE TELEPHONES

Ripping off the phone company is so common that Bell Telephone  has a special security division that tries to stay just a little  ahead of the average free-loader. Many great devices like the coat  hanger release switch have been scrapped because of changes in the  phone box. Even the credit card fake-out is doomed to oblivion as  the company switches to more computerized techniques. ln our  opinion, as long as there is a phone company, and as long as there  are outlaws, nobody need ever pay for a call. In 1969 alone the  phone company estimated that over 10 million dollars worth of free  calls were placed from New York City. Nothing, however, compares  with the rip-off of the people by the phone company. In that same  year, American Telephone and Telegraph made a profit of 8.6 billion  dollars! AT&T, like all public utilities, passes itself off as a  service owned by the people, while in actuality nothing could be  further from the truth. Only a small percentage of the public owns  stock in these companies and a tiny elite clique makes all the  policy decisions. Ripping-off the phone company is an act of  revolutionary love, so help spread the word.

PAY PHONES

You can make a local 10 cent call for 2 cents by spitting on  the pennies and dropping them in the nickel slot. As soon as they  are about to hit the trigger mechanism, bang the coin-return  button. Another way is to spin the pennies counter-clockwise into  the nickel slot. Hold the penny in the slot with your finger and  snap it spinning with a key or other flat object. Both systems take  a certain knack, but once you've perfected the technique, you'll  always have it in your survival kit.

If two cents is too much, how about a call for 1 penny? Cut a  1/4 strip off the telephone book cover. Insert the cardboard strip  into the dime slot as far as it will go. Drop a penny in the nickel  slot until it catches in the mechanism (spinning will help). Then  slowly pull the strip out until you hear the dial tone.

A number 14 brass washer with a small piece of scotch tape  over one side of the hole will not only get a free call, but works  in about any vending machine that takes dimes. You can get a box of  thousands for about a dollar at any hardware store. You should  always have a box around for phones, laundromats, parking meters  and drink machines.

Bend a bobby pin after removing the plastic from the tips and  jab it down into the transmitter (mouthpiece). When it presses  against the metal diaphragm, rub it on a metal wall or pipe to  ground it. When you've made contact you'll hear the dial tone. If  the phone uses old-fashioned rubber black tubing to enclose the  wires running from the headset to the box, you can insert a metal  tack through the tubing, wiggle it around a little until it makes  contact with the bare wires and touch the tack to a nearby metal  object for grounding.

Put a dime in the phone, dial the operator and tell her you  have ten cents credit. She'll return your dime and get your call  for free. If she asks why, say you made a call on another pay  phone, lost the money, and the operator told you to switch phones  and call the credit operator.

This same method works for long distance calls. Call the  operator and find out the rate for your call. Hang up and call  another operator telling her you just dialed San Francisco direct,  got a wrong number and lost $.95 or whatever it is. She will get  your call free of charge.

If there are two pay phones next to each other, you can call  long distance on one and put the coins in the other. When the  operator cuts in and asks you to deposit money, drop the coins into  the one you are not using, but hold the receiver up to the slots so  the operator can hear the bells ring. When you've finished, you can  simply press the return button on the phone with the coins in it  and out they come. If you have a good tape recorder you can record  the sounds of a quarter, dime and nickel going into a pay phone and  play them for the operator in various combinations when she asks  for the money. Turn the volume up as loud as you can get it.

You can make a long distance call and charge it to a phone  number. Simply tell the operator you want to bill the call to your  home phone because you don't have the correct change. Tell her  there is no one there now to verify the call, but you will be home  in an hour and she can call you then if there is any question. Make  sure the exchange goes with the area you say it does.

Always have a number of made-up credit card numbers. The code  letter for 1970 is S, then seven digits of the phone number and a  three digit district number (not the same as area code). The  district number should be under 599. Example: S-573-2100-421 or  S-537-3402-035. Look up the phone numbers for your area by simply  requesting a credit card for your home phone which is very easy to  get and then using the last three numbers with another phone  number. Usually making up exotic numbers from far away places will  work quite well as it would be impossible for an operator to spot a  phony number in the short time she has to check her list.

We advise against making phony credit card calls on a home  phone. We have seen a gadget that you install between the wall  socket and the cord which not only allows you to receive all the  calls you want for free, but eliminates the most common form of  electronic bugging. They are being manufactured and sold for fifty  dollars by a disgruntled telephone engineer in Massachusetts.  Unfortunately you are going to have to find him on your own or  duplicate his efforts, for he has sworn us to secrecy. If someone  does, however, offer you such a device, it probably does work. Test  it by installing it and having someone call you from a pay phone.  If it's working, the person should get their dime back at the end  of the call.

Actually  if you know the slightest information about wiring,  you can have your present phone disconnected on the excuse that  you'll be leaving town for a few months and then connect the wires  into the main trunk lines on your own. Extensions can easily be  attached to your main line without the phone company knowing about  it.

You can make all the free long distance calls you want by  calling your party collect at a pay phone. Just have your friend go  to a prearranged phone booth at a prearranged time. This can be  done on the spot by having the friend call you person to person.  Say you're not in, but ask for the number calling you since you'll  be "back" in five minutes. Once you get the number simply hang up,  wait a moment and call back your friend collect. The call has to be  out of the state to work, since operators are familiar with the  special extension numbers assigned to pay phones for her area and  possibly for nearby areas as well. If she asks you if it is a pay  phone say no. If she finds out during the call (which rarely  happens) and informs you of this, simply say you didn't expect the  party to have a pay phone in his house and accept the charges. We  have never heard of this happening though. The trick of calling  person-to-person collect should always be used when calling long  distance on home-to-home phones also. You can hear the voice of  your friend saying that he'll be back in a few minutes. Simply hang  up, wait a moment and call station to station, thereby getting a  person-to-person call without the extra charges which can be  considerable on a long call during business hours.

If you plan to stay at your present address for only a few  more months, stop paying the bill and call like crazy. After a  month you get the regular bill which you avoid paying. Another  month goes by and the next bill comes with last month's balance  added to it. Shortly thereafter you get a note advising you that  your service will be terminated in ten days if you don't pay the  bill. Wait a few days and send them a five or ten dollar money  order with a note saying you've had an accident and are pressed for  funds because of large medical bills, but you'll send them the  balance as soon as you are up and around again. That will hold them  for another month. In all, you can stretch it out for four or five  months with a variety of excuses and small payments. This also  works with the gas and electric companies and with any department  stores you conned into letting you charge.

You can get the service deposit reduced to half of the normal  rate if you are a student or have other special qualifications.  Surprisingly, these rates and discounts vary from area to area, so  check around before you go into the business office for your phone.  There is an incredible 50 cents charge per month for not having  your phone listed. If you want an unlisted phone, you can avoid  this fee by having the phone listed in a fictitious name, even if  the bill is sent to you. Just say you want your roommate's name  listed instead of your own.

FREE PLAY

MOVIES AND CONCERTS

There are many ways to sneak into theaters, concerts, stadiums  and other entertainment houses. All these places have numerous fire  exits with push-bar doors that open easily from the inside. Arrive  early with a group of friends, after casing the joint and selecting  the most convenient exit. Pay for one person to get in. When he  does he simply opens the designated exit door when the ushers are  out of the area and everyone rushes inside.

For theatrical chains in large cities, call their home office  and ask to speak to the vice-president in charge of publicity,  sales, or personnel. Ask what his name is so you'll know who you're  talking to. When you get the information you want, hang up. Now you  have the name of a high official in the company. Compile a short  list of officials in the various film, theater and sporting event  companies. Next all the various theaters and do the same thing for  the theater managers. Once you have the two lists you are ready to  proceed. Call the theater you want to attend. When someone answers  say you're Mr. __________ from the home office calling Mr. __________  (manager's name) and you'd like to have two passes O.K'd for two  important people from out of town. Invariably she'll just ask their  names or tell them to mention your name at the box office. Not only  will you get in free, but you can avoid waiting in line with this  fake-out.

In Los Angeles and New York, the studios hold pre-release  screenings for all movies. If you know roughly when a movie is  about to come out, call the publicity department of the studio  producing the film and say you're the critic for a newspaper or  magazine (give the name) and ask them when you can screen the film.  They'll give you the time and place of various screenings. When you  go, ask them to put you on their list and you'll get notices of all  future screenings.

One of our favorite ways to sneak into a theater with  continuously running shows is the following. Arrive just as the  show is emptying out and join the line leaving the theater.  Exclaiming, "Oh, my gosh!" you slap your forehead, turn around and  return, tell the usher you left your hat, pocketbook, etc. inside.  Once you're inside the theater, just swipe some popcorn and wait  for the next show.

RECORDS AND BOOKS

If you have access to a few addresses, you can get all kinds  of records and books from clubs on introductory offers. Since the  cards you mail back are not signed there is no legal way you can be  held for the bill. You get all sorts of threatening mail, which, by  the way, also comes free.

If you have a friend who is a member of a record club, ask him  to submit your name as a free member. He gets 4 free records for  getting you signed up. A soon as you get the letter saying how  lucky you are to be a member, quit. Your friend's free records have  already been shipped. We used to have at least 10 different names  and addresses working on all the record and book companies. Every  other day we would ride around collecting the big packages. To cap  it off, we opened a credit account at a large department store and  used to return most of the records and books to the store saying  that they were gifts and we wanted something else. Since we had an  account at the store, they always took the merchandise and gave  credit for future purchases.

You can always use the public libraries. Find out when they do  their yearly housecleaning. Every library discards thousands of  books on this day. Just show up and ask if you can take some.

Almost anything you might want to know from plans for  constructing a sundial to a complete blueprint for building a house  may be obtained free from the Government Printing Office. Write: to  Superintendent of Documents, Government Printing Office, Washington  D.C. 20402. Most publication are free. Those that are not are dirt  cheap. Ask to be put on the list to receive the free biweekly list  of Selected U.S. Government Publications.

One of the best ways to receive records and books free is to  invest twenty dollars and print up some stationery with an artistic  logo for some non-existent publication. Write to all the public  relations departments of record companies, publishing houses, and  movie studios. Say you are a newspaper with a large youth  readership and have regular reviews of books, or records, or  movies, and would like to be placed on their mailing list. Say that  you would be glad to send them any reviews of their records that  appear in the paper. That adds a note of authenticity to the  letter. After a month or so you'll be receiving more records and  books than you can use.

If you really want a book badly enough, follow the title of  this one-Dig!

FREE MONEY

No book on survival should fail to give you some good tips on  how to rip-off bread. Really horning in on this chapter will put  you on Free-loader Street life, 'cause with all the money in  Amerika, the only thing you'll have trouble getting is poor.

WELFARE

It's easy to get on welfare that anyone who is broke and  doesn't have a regular relief check coming in is nothing but a  goddamn lazy bum! Each state has a different set up. The racist  penny-pinchers of Mississippi dole out only $8.00 a month. New York  dishes ont the most with monthly payments up to $120.00. The  Amerikan Public Welfare Association publishes a book called The  Public Welfare Directory with information on exactly what each  welfare agency provides and how you go about qualifying. You can  read the directory at any public library to find out all you can  about how your local office operates.

When you've discovered everything you need to know, head on  down to the Welfare Department in your grubbiest clothes. Not  sleeping the night before helps. The receptionist will assign an  "intaker" to interview you. After a long wait, you'll be directed  to a desk. The intaker raps to you for a while, generally showing  sympathy for your plight and turns you over to the caseworker who  will make the final and ultimate assessment.

Have your heaviest story ready to ooze out. If you have no  physical disabilities, lay down a "mentally deranged" rap. Getting  medical papers saying you have any long-term illness or defect  helps a lot. Tell the caseworker you get dizzy spells on the job  and faint in the street. Keep bobbing your head, yawning, or  scratching. Tell him that you have tried to commit suicide recently  because you just can't make it in a world that has forgotten how to  love. Don't lay it on too obviously. Wait till he "pries" some of  the details from you. This makes the story even more convincing.  Many welfare workers are young and hip. The image you are working  on is that of a warm, sensitive kid victimized by brutal parents  and a cold ruthless society. Tell them you held off coming for  months because you wanted to maintain some self-respect even though  have been walking the streets broke and hungry. If you are a woman  tell him you were recently raped. In sexist Amerika, this will  probably be true.

After about an hour or so of this soap-opera stuff, you'll be  ready to get your first check. From then on it's a monthly check,  complete medical care for free and all sorts of other outasight  benefits. Occasionally the caseworker will drop by your pad or ask  you down to the office to see how you're coming along, but with  your condition, things don't look so good. Don't abandon hope  though. Hope always helps fill in a caseworker's report.

The real trick is to parlay welfare payments in a few  different states. Work out an exchange system with a buddy and mail  each other the checks when they come in. If the caseworker comes  by, your roommate can say you went to find a job or enrolled in a  class. We know cats who have parlayed welfare payments up to six  hundred dollars a month.

UNEMPLOYMENT

Every outlaw should learn everything there is to know about  the rules governing unemployment insurance. As in the case of  welfare rules, eligibility, and the size of payments differ from  state to state. In New York, you are eligible for payments  equivalent to half your weekly salary before taxes up to $65 per  week, on the condition that you have worked for a minimum of twenty  weeks during the year. Payments are somewhat lower in most other  states. In order to collect, you must show you are actively  searching for a job and keep a record of employers you contact.  This can easily be fudged. Every time you're questioned about it,  mention one or two companies. If your hair is long, you'll have no  problem. Just say they won't hire you until you get a haircut. When  this is the case, the unemployment office cannot cut off your  payments or your hair. They also cannot make you accept a job you  do not want. Tell them any job offer you get is not challenging  enough for your talents. Unemployment can be collected for six  months before payments are terminated. Twenty more weeks of slavery  and you can go back to maintaining your dignity in the unemployment  line. These job insurance payments cannot be taxed and since you  are working so few weeks out of each year, your taxable income is  at a minimum. Read all the fine print for tax form 1040 and  discover all the deductible loopholes available to you. You should  wind up paying no taxes at all or having all the taxes that were  deducted from your pay reimbursed. Never turn over to the pig  government any funds you can rip off. Remember, it isn't your  government, so why submit to its taxation if you feel you do not  have representation.

PANHANDLING

The practice of going up to folks and bumming money is a basic  hustling art. If you are successful at panhandling, you'll be able  to master all the skills in the book and then some. To be good at  it requires a complete knowledge of what motivates people. Even if  we don't need the bread, we panhandle on the streets in the same  way doctors go back to medical school. It helps us stay in shape.  Panhandling is illegal throughout Pig Empire, but it's one of those  laws that is rarely enforced unless they want to "clean the area"  of hippies. If you're in a strange locale, ask a fellow panhandler  what the best places to work are without risking a bust. Do it in  front of supermarkets, theaters, sporting events, hip dress shops  and restaurants. College cafeterias are very good hunting grounds.

When you're hustling, be assertive. Don't lean against the  wall with your palm out mumbling "Spare some change?" Go up to  people and stand directly in front of them so they have to look you  in the eye and say no. Bum from guys with dates. Bum from motherly  looking types. After a while you'll get a sense of the type of  people you get results with.

Theater can be real handy. The best actors get the most bread.  Devising a street theater skit can help. A good prop is a charity  canister. You can get them by going to the offices of a mainstream  charity and signing up as a collector. Don't feel bad about ripping  them off. Charities are the biggest swindle around. 80% or more of  the funds raised by honky charities go to the organization itself.  New fancy cars for the Red Cross, inflated salaries for the  executives of the Cancer Fund, tax write-offs for Jerry Lewis. You  get the picture. A good way to work this and keep your karma in  shape is to turn over half to a revolutionary groups such as your  local underground. Remember, fugitives from injustice depend on you  to survive. Be a responsible member of our nation. Support the only  war we have going!

RIP-OFFS

If you are closing out your checking account, overdraw your  account by $10.00. The bank won't bother chasing you down for a  lousy 10 bucks.

Call the telephone operator from time to time and tell her you  lost some change in a pay phone. They will mail you the cash.

You can get $150 to $600 in advance by willing your body to a  University medical school. They have you sign a lot of papers and  put a tattoo on your foot. You can get the tattoo removed and sell  your body to the folks across the street. The universities can be  ripped off by enrolling, applying for a loan and bugging out after  the loan comes through. This is a lot easier than you might imagine  and you can hit them for up to $2,500 with a good enough story.

Put a number 14 brass washer in a newspaper vending machine  and take out all the papers. Stand around the corner or go into the  local bar and sell them. You often get tipped. Don't do this with  underground papers. Remember they're your brothers and sisters.

The airlines will give you $250 for each piece of luggage you  lose when flying. The following is a good way to lose your luggage.  When you get off a plane, have a friend meet you at the gate. Give  him your luggage claim stubs and arrange to meet at a washroom or  restaurant. Your friend picks up the bags and takes them out of the  baggage room. Before he leaves the airport, he turns over the stubs  to you at your prearranged rendezvous. You casually wander over to  the baggage department and search for your elusive luggage. When  all the baggage has been claimed, file a complaint with the lost  and found department. They'll have you fill out a form, explain  that it probably got misplaced on another carrier and promise to  send it to you as soon as it is located. In a month you'll receive  a check for $250 per bag. Enjoy your flight.

THE INTERNATIONAL YIPPIE CURRENCY EXCHANGE

Every time you drop a coin into a slot, you are losing money  needlessly. There is at least one foreign coin that is the same  size or close enough that will do the trick for less than a penny.  The following are some of the foreign currencies that will get you  that Coke, call or subway ride.

Quarter Size Coins

¥ URUGUAYAN 10 CENTISIMO PIECE

¥ works in many soda and candy machines,  older telephones (3 slot types), toll machines, laundromats,  parking meters, stamp machines, and restroom novelty machines.  Works also in some electric cancerette machines but not most  mechanical machines.

¥ DANISH 5 ORE PIECE

¥ works in 3 slot telephones, toll machines,  laundromats, automats, some stamp machines, most novelty machines,  and the Boston Subway. Does not work in soda or cancerette  machines.

¥ PERUVIAN 20 CENTAVO PIECES

¥ works in new (one slot) telephone and 
some electric cancerette machines, but does not work as many places  in the Uruguay, Danish and Peruvian coins.

¥ ICELANDIC 5 AURAN PIECE

¥ most effective quarter in the world, even  works in change machines. Unfortunately, this coin is practically  impossible to get outside of Iceland and even there, it is becoming  difficult since the government is attempting to remove it from  circulation.

Dime Size Coins

¥ MALAYSIAN PENNY

¥ generally works in all dime slots, including old  and new telephones, candy machines, soda machines, electric  machines, stamp machines, parking meters, photocopy machines, and  pay toilets. Does not work in some newer stamp dispensers, and some  mechanical cancerette machines.

¥ TRINIDAD PENNY

¥ generally works the same as Malaysian Penny.

New York Subway Tokens

¥ DANISH 25 ORE PIECE

¥ works in 95% of all subway turnstiles. A very  safe coin to use since it will not jam the turnstile. It is  5/l000th of an inch bigger than a token.

¥ PORTUGUESE 50 CENTAVO PIECE

¥ the average Portuguese Centavo Piece is  2/1000th of an inch smaller than a token.

¥ JAMAICAN HALF PENNY, BAHAMA PENNY and AUSTRALIAN SCHILLING

¥ these coins are 12/l000th to 15/1000th of an inch smaller than token.  They work in about 80% of all turnstiles. We have also had good  success with FRENCH l FRANC PIECE (WWII issue), SPANISH l0 CENTAVO  PIECE NICARAGUAN 25 CENTAVO PIECE.

All of the coins listed have a currency value of a few cents,  with most less than one penny. Foreign coins work more regularly  than slugs and are non-magnetic, hence cannot be detected by "slug  detector machines." Also unlike slugs, although they are illegal to  use in machines, they are perfectly legal to possess and exchange.

Large coin dealers and currency exchanges are generally  uptight about handling cheap foreign coins in quantity since they  don't make much profit and are subject to certain pressures in  selling coins that are the same size as Amerikan coins or tokens.

People planning trips to European or South American countries  should bring back rolls of coins as souvenirs or for use in "coin  jewelry."

If you do not plan to travel, a small coin store which is cool  about selling to the public is located on the Lower East Side at  191 East Third Street, New York City. When their phone works, the  number is 475-9897.

Washers are the most popular types of slugs. You can go to any  hardware store and match them up with various coins. Sometimes you  might have to put a small piece of scotch tape over one side of the  hole to make it more effective. Each washer is identified by its  material and number, i.e. No. 14 brass washer with scotch tape on  one side is a perfect dime. When you get the ones you want, you can  buy thousands for next to nothing (especially at industrial supply  stores) and pass them out to our friends.

Xerox copies of both sides of a dollar bill, carefully glued  together, work in most machines that give you change for a dollar.  Excuse us, there is a knock at the door. . .Fancy that! It's the  Treasury Department. Wonder what they want?

FREE DOPE

BUYING, SELLING AND GIVING IT AWAY

As you probably know, most dope is illegal, therefore some  risks are always involved in buying and selling. "Eternal vigilance  and constant mobility are the passwords of survival," said Che  Guevara, and nowhere do they apply more than in the world of dope.  If you ever have the slightest doubt about the person with whom  you're dealing-DON'T.

Buying

In the purchasing of dope, arrests are not a problem unless  you're the fall guy for a bust on the dealer. The major hazard is  getting burned. Buy from a friend or a reputable dealer. If you  have to do business with a stranger, be extra careful. Never front  money. One of the burn artist's tricks is to take your money, tell  you to wait and split with your dough. There are various side show  gimmicks each burn artist works. The most common is to ask you to  walk with them a few blocks and then stop in front of an apartment  building. He then tells you the dope is upstairs and asks you to  hand over the money in advance. He explains that his partner is the  real uptight 'cause they were raided once and won't let anybody in  the pad. He takes your dough and disappears inside the building.  Out the back door or up to the roof and into his getaway  helicopter. You are left on the sidewalk with anxious eyes and that  "can this really be happening to me" feeling.

Another burn method is to substitute oregano, parsley or  catnip for pot, camel shit for hash, saccharin or plain pills for  acid. If you got burned for heroin or speed, you're better off  being taken, because these are body-fuck drugs that can mess you up  badly. The people that deal them are total pigs and should be  regarded as such. When you're buying from strangers, you have a  right to sample the merchandise free unless it's coke. Check the  weight of grass with a small pocket scale. Feel the texture and  check out how well it has been cleaned of seeds and twigs. Smoke a  joint that is rolled from the stuff you get. Don't accept the  dealer's sample that he pulled out of his pocket. When you are  buying a large amount of acid, pick a sample. You should never buy  acid from a stranger as it is too easy a burn.

If you buy cocaine, bring along a black light. Only the  imparities glow under its fluorescence, thus giving you an idea of  the quality of the coke. Make sure it's the real thing. Sniffing  coke can perforate your nasal passages, so be super moderate. Too  much will kill you. A little bit goes a long way.

Selling

Dealing, although dangerous, is a tax-free way of surviving  even though it borders on work. The best way to start is to save up  a little bread and buy a larger quantity than you usually get. Then  deal out smaller amounts to your friends. The fewer strangers you  deal with, the safer you are. The price of dope varies with the  amount of stuff on the market in your area, the heat the narks are  bringing down and the connections you have. A rough scale, say, for  pot is $20 an ounce, $125 a pound and $230 a kilo (2.2 pounds). The  price per ounce decreases depending on the amount you get. It's  true you make more profit selling by the ounces, but the hassle is  greater and the more contacts you must make increases the risk.  Screwing your customers will prove to be bad karma (unless you  consider dying groovy), so stick to honest dealing. Never deal from  your pad and avoid keeping your stash there. Get into searching out  the best markets which are generally in California, given its close  proximity to good ol' Mexico. Kansas is a big distribution center  for Mexican grass, too. You can ship the stuff (safer than  carrying) via air freight anywhere in the country for about $30 a  trunk. Keep the sending and receiving end looking straight. We have  one friend who wears a priest's outfit to ship and receive dope. In  fact, every time we see nuns or priests on the street, we assume  they're outlaws just on their way to the next deal or bombing. For  all we know, the church actually is nothing but a huge dope ring in  drag. Anybody gotten high off communion wafers lately?

When you talk about deals on the phone, be cool. Make  references to theater tickets or subscriptions. Don't keep  extensive notes on your activities and contacts. Use code names  where you can. Never deal with two other people present. Only you  and the buyer should be in the immediate vicinity. Narks make busts  in pairs so one can be the arresting officer and the other can be a  court witness. Dealing is a paradox of unloading a good amount of  shit but not trying to move too fast; of making ne contacts but  being careful of strangers; of dealing high quality and low prices;  and of being simultaneously bold and cautious. If you get nabbed,  get the best lawyer who specializes in dope busts. First offenders  rarely end up serving time, but it's a different story for  repeaters. Know how punitive the courts are and which judges and  prosecutors can be bought off. Never deal in the month before an  election. For complete information on how to avoid getting busted  and what to do if busted, read The Drug Bust (listed in appendix).

Giving It Away

Giving dope away can be a real mind-blower. Every dealer  should submit to voluntary taxation by the new Nation. If you are a  conscientious dealer, you should be willing and eager to give a  good hunk of your stash away at special events or to groups into  free distribution. You should also be able to give bread to bust  trusts set up to bail out heads unable to get up the ransom money  the whisky lush courts demand. Many groups have done huge mailings  of joints to all sorts of people. A group in New York mailed 30,000  to people in the phone book on one Valentine's Day. A group in  Los Angeles placed over 2,000 joints in library books and then  advised kids to smoke a book during National Library Week. Be cool  about even giving stuff away since that counts as dealing in most  states. John Sinclair, Chairman of the White Panther Party, is  serving 9¸ to 10 years for giving away two joints.

GROW YOUR OWN

Pot is a weed and as such grows in all climates under every  kind of soil condition. We have seen acres and acres of grass  growing in Kansas, Iowa and New Jersey. If you're not located next  door to a large pot field growing in the wild, maybe you would have  some success in growing your own. It's well worth it to try your  potluck!

The first thing is to start with a bunch of good-quality seeds  from grass that you really dig. Select the largest seeds and place  them between two heavy-duty napkins or ink blotters in a pan. Soak  the napkins with water until completely saturated. Cover the top of  the pan or place it in a dark closet for three days or until a  sprout about a half inch long appears from most of the seeds.

During this incubation period, you can prepare the seedling  bed. Use a low wooden box such as a tomato flat and fill it with an  inch of gravel. Fill the rest of the box with some soil mixed with  a small amount of fertilizer. Moisten the soil until water seeps  out the bottom of the box, then level the soil making a flat  surface. With a pencil, punch holes two inches apart in straight  rows. You can get about 2 dozen in a tomato flat.

When the incubation period is over, take those seeds that have  an adequate sprout and plant one in each hole. The sprout goes down  and the seed part should be a little above ground. Tamp the soil  firmly (do not pack) around each plant as you insert the sprouts.

The seedlings should remain in their boxes in a sunny window  until about mid-May. They should receive enough water during this  period to keep the soil moist. By the time they are ready to go  into the ground, the green plants should be about six to eight  inches tall.

If it is late winter or early spring and you have a plot of  land that gets enough sun and is sheltered from nosy neighbors, you  should definitely grow grass in the great outdoors.

One idea is to plant sunflowers in your garden as these grow  taller than the pot plants and camouflage them from view. The best  idea is to find some little-used field and plant a section of it.

Prepare the land the way you would for any garden vegetable.  Dig up the ground with a pitchfork or heavy duty rake, removing  rocks. Rake the plot level and punch holes in the soil about three  inches deep and about two feet apart in the same way you did in the  seedling boxes. Remove the young plants from the box, being careful  not to disturb the roots and keeping as much soil intact as  possible. Transplant each plant into one of the punched-out holes  and firmly press the soil to hold it in place. When all the plants  are in the ground, water the entire area. Tend them the way you  would any other garden. They should reach a height of about six  feet by the end of the summer and be ready to harvest.

If you don't have access to a field, you can grow good stuff  right in your own closet or garage using artificial lighting.  Transplant the plants into larger wooden boxes or flower boxes. Be  sure and cover the bottom of each box with a few inches of pebbles  or broken pottery before you add the soil. This will insure proper  drainage. Fertilize the soil according to the instructions on the  box and punch out holes in much the same way you would do if you  were growing outside. After the young plants have been transplanted  and watered thoroughly, you will have to rig up a lighting system.  Use blue light bulbs, which are available at hardware stores for  the first thirty days. These insure a shorter, sturdier stalk.  Leave the lights on 24 hours a day and place them about a foot  above the tops of the plants. If the plants begin to feel brittle  or turn yellow at the edges, then the temperature is too hot. Use  less illumination or raise the height of the lamp if this occurs.

After the first thirty days, change to red bulbs and cut down  the lighting time to 16 hours a day. After a week, reduce the time  to 14 hours and then on the third week to 12 hours. Maintain this  lighting period until the plants flower. The female plants have a  larger and heavier flower structure and the males are somewhat  skimpy. The female plant produces the stronger grass and the  choicest parts are the top leaves including the flowers.

Inside or outside, the plants will be best if allowed to reach  maturity, although they are smokeable at any point along the way.  When you want to harvest the crop, wet the soil and pull out the  entire plant. If you want to separate the top leaves from the rest,  you can do so and make two qualities of grass. In any event, let  the plants dry in the sun for two weeks until they are thoroughly  dried out. If you want to hurry the drying process, you can do it  in an oven using a very low heat for about twenty minutes. After  you've completed the drying, you can "cure'" the grass by putting  the plants in plastic bags and sprinkling drops of wine, rum or  plain booze on them. This greatly increases the potency.

There are two other ways that we know work to increase the  potency of grass you grow or buy. One consists of digging a hole  and burying a stash of grass wrapped in a plastic bag. A few months  in the ground will produce a mouldy grass that is far fuckin' out.  A quick method is to get a hunk of dry ice, put it in a metal  container or box with a tight lid (taping the lid airtight helps),  and sprinkling the grass on top. Allow it to sit tightly covered  for about three days until all the dry ice evaporates.

ASSORTED FREEBIES

LAUNDRY

Wait in a laundromat. Tell someone with a light load that  you'll watch the machine for them if you can stick your clothes in  with theirs.

PETS

Your local ASPCA will give you a free dog, cat, bird or other  pet. Have them inspect and inoculate the animal which they will do  free of charge. You can get free or very cheap medical care for  your pet at a school for veterinary medicine.

Underground newspapers often carry a free-pets column in the  back pages. Snakes can be caught in any wooded area and they make  great pets. You can collect insects pretty easy. Ants are  unbelievable to watch. You can make a simple 3/4 inch wide glass  case about a foot high, fill it with sand and start an ant colony.  A library book will tell you how to care for them.

Every year the National Park Service gives away surplus elks  in order to keep the herds under its jurisdiction from outgrowing  the amount of available land for grazing. Write to: Superintendent,  Yellowstone National Park, Yellowstone, Wyoming 83020. You must be  prepared to pay the freight charges for shipping the animal and  guarantee that you can provide enough grazing land to keep the big  fellow happy.

Under the same arrangement the government will send you a Free  Buffalo. Write to: Office of Information, Department of the  Interior, Washington, D.C. 20420. So many people have written them  recently demanding their Free Buffalo, that they called a press conference to publicly attack the Yippies for creating chaos in the  government. Don't take any buffalo shit from these petty  bureaucrats, demand the real thing. Demand your Free Buffalo.

You can get a free l6mm movie about parakeets called "More Fun  with Parakeets," by writing to: R.T. French Co., 9068 Mustard St.,  Rochester, New York 14609. This great film won an Academy Award for  best picture of 1793.

POSTERS

Beautiful wall posters are available by writing to the  National Tourist Agencies of various countries. Most are located  between 42nd and 59th Streets on Fifth Ave. in New York City. You  can find their addresses in the New York Yellow Pages under both  National Tourist Agencies and Travel Agencies. There are over fifty  of them. Prepare a form letter saying you are a high school  geography teacher and would like some posters of the country to  decorate your classroom. In a month you will be flooded with them.  Airline companies also have colorful wall posters they send out  free.

SECURITY

For this trick you need some money to begin with. Deposit it  in a bank and return in a few weeks telling them you lost your bank  book. They give you a card to fill out and sign and in a week you  will receive another book. Now withdraw your money, leaving you  with original money and a bank book showing a balance. You can use  this as identification to prevent vagrancy busts when traveling, as  collateral for bail, or for opening a charge account at a store.

Another trick is to buy some American Travelers Checks. Wait a  week and report your checks lost. They'll give you new ones to  replace the missing ones. You spend your new checks and keep the  ones you reported lost as security. This security is great for  international travel especially at border crossings. If you want,  you can spend the Travelers Checks by giving them to a friend to  forge your name. Before you call the office to report the loss,  call the police station and say you were mugged and your wallet was  stolen. The agency always asks if you have reported the lost checks  to the police, so you can safely answer yes. Never do this for more  than five hundred dollars and never more than once with any one  company.

POSTAGE

When mailing to the same city, address the envelope or package  to yourself and put the name of the person you are sending it to  where the return address generally goes. Mail it without postage  and it will be "returned" to the sender. Because almost all letters  are machine processed, any stamp that is the correct size will  pass. Easter Seals and a variety of other type stamps usually get  by the electronic scanner. If you put the stamp on a spot other  than the far upper right corner, it will not be cancelled and can  be used again by the person who gets your letter. If you have a  friend working in a large corporation, you can run your  organization's mail through their postage meter.

Those ridiculous free introductory or subscription type  letters that you get in the mail often have a postage-guaranteed  return postcard for your convenience. The next one you get, paste  it on a brick and drop it in the mailbox. The company is required  by law to pay the postage. You can also get rid of all your garbage  this way.

MAPS

You can get a free full-color World Atlas by writing to  Hammond Inc. Maplewood, New Jersey 07040.

MINISTRY

Unquestionably one of the best deals going is becoming a  minister in the Universal Life Church. They will send you  absolutely free, bona fide ordination papers. These entitle you to  all sorts of discounts and tax exemptions. Right now, sit down and  write to Universal Life Church Inc., 601 3rd St., Modesto,  California 95351. Try cutting out the card on the following page  and laminate it. Let us know how it works out.

ATROCITIES

Join the Army!

VETERAN'S BENEFITS

Write to the Veteran's Administration Information Service,  Washington, D.C. 20420 asking them for the free services they  provide for veterans. Send fifteen cents to the Government Printing  Office for their booklet Federal Benefits Available to Veterans and  Their Dependents.

WATCH

A $330 Bulova sport timer accurate to 1/10 of a second will be  lent free to judges and referees to time any amateur sporting  event. Call your local authorized Bulova dealer and get one lent to  you under a phony name. Tell them you want to time an orgy.

VACATIONS

There are many ways to take a free vacation, but here's one  you might not have considered. It's an all-expenses paid trip to  Las Vegas for absolutely nothing. Call a travel agent and request  information about Las Vegas gambling junkets (you'll probably have  to hunt around because this practice is being curtailed). Different  hotels have different deals, but the average one runs something  like this: If you agree to buy $500 worth of chips that can only be  spent on gambling tables of the host hotel, they will fly you round  trip, pay all hotel and food bills and provide you with a rented  car. Go with a close friend and check into the hotel. Once at the  roulette or craps table, you and your friend bet the same amount of  chips against each other on even-paying chances. For example, he  would bet on red and you on black. When either of you wins, you  keep the house chips; when you lose, turn in the specially marked  chips that cannot be cashed in. What you are doing is simply  exchanging the chips you came with for house chips that you can  cash in for real dough. Theoretically your two vacations should  cost $23.00 if you do the betting at the crap table and $52.00 if  you bet even chances at roulette. That is because the house wins if  0 or 00 comes up in roulette and if 12 comes up on the first roll  of the dice, but it sure is a hell of a vacation for two for  $23.00, and you get free champagne on some flights.

You can get half a vacation free by going to the Amerikan  Embassy or Consulate in the country you find yourself in and claim  that you're destitute.	There is a law on the books that says they  have to send you away, but be persistent. Make up a story about how  your parents are away from home traveling. Say you got mugged or  something and you are about to go to the newspapers with your  story. Eventually they'll get you a free plane ticket. They stamp  your passport invalid though, and you have to pay the government  back before you can use it again.

DRINKS

When hitching, it's a good idea to carry a bottle opener and a  straw. You take the caps off soda bottles while they're still in  the machine and drink them dry without ever touching the bottle.

BURIALS

For ways to avoid the high cost of dying in Amerika, write to:  Continental Association, 39 East Van Buren St., Chicago, Ill.  60605. Send them $1.00 for the Manual of Simple Burial and 25¢ for  a list of Memorial Associates.

ASTRODOME PICTURES

Don't you just have to have a huge, glossy color photo of  Houston's famed Astrodome to show all your friends? Use the teacher  bit and write to: Greater Houston Convention and Visitors Council,  1600 Main St., Houston, Texas 77002.

DIPLOMA

Above the paper towel dispenser in a service station restroom  was written: "San Francisco State Diplomas." If  you really need a  college or a high school diploma, send $2.00 to Glenco, Box 834,  Warren, Michigan 48090. They send you one that looks real  authentic. It ain't Harvard, but it looks good enough to frame and  put on your wall.

TOILETS

Tell It All, Brothers and Sisters

STARTING A PRINTING WORKSHOP

Leaflets, posters, newsletters, pamphlets and other printed  matter are important to any revolution. A printing workshop is a  definite need in all communities, regardless of size. It can vary  from a garage with a mimeograph machine to a mammoth operation  complete with printing presses and fancy photo equipment. With less  than a hundred dollars and some space, you can begin this vital  service. It'll take a while before you get into printing  greenbacks, phony identification papers and credit cards like the  big boys, but to walk a mile you must start with one step as  Gutenberg once said.

Paper

The standard size for paper is 8¸" x 11". It comes 500 sheets  to a "ream" and 10 reams to a case. You want a 16-20 bond weight  sheet. The higher weights are better if you are printing on both  sides. You can purchase what are termed "odd lots" from most paper  companies. This means that the colors will be assorted and some  sheets will be frayed at the edges or wrinkled. Odd lots can be  purchased at great discounts. Some places sell paper this way for  10% of the original price and for leaflets, different colors help.  Check this out with paper suppliers in your area.

Ink

Inks come in pastes and liquids and are available in  stationary stores and office supply houses. Each machine requires  its own type ink, so learn what works best with the one you have.  Colored ink is slightly more expensive but available for most  machines.

Stencils

Each machine uses a particular size and style stencil. If you  get stuck with the wrong kind and can't get out to correct the  mistake, you can punch extra holes in the top, trim them with a  scissors if they are too big or add strips of tape to the sides if  too narrow.

Be sure and use only the area that will fit on the paper you  are using. Most stencils can be used for paper larger than standard  size. Stencils will "cut" a lot neater if an electric typewriter is  used. If you only have access to e manual machine, remove the  ribbon so the keys will strike the stencil directly. A plastic  sheet, provided by the supplier, can be inserted between the  stencil and its backing to provide sharper cuts by the keys. If you  hold the stencil up to a light, you should be able to clearly see  the typing. If you can't, you'll have to apply more pressure.

Sketches can be done with a ball point pen or special stylus  directly on the stencil. If you're really rushed, or there isn't  that much info to get on the leaflet, you can hand-print the text  using these instruments. Take care not to tear the stencil.

Mimeograph Machines

The price of a new mimeograph runs from $200 to $1200,  depending on how sophisticated a machine you need and can afford.  A.B. Dick and Gestetner are the most popular brands. Many supply  houses have used machines for sale. Check the classified section  for bargains. See if any large corporations are moving, going out  of business or have just had a fire. Chances are they'll be  unloading printing equipment at cheap prices. Campaign offices of  losing candidates often have mimeos to unload in November. Many  supply houses have renting and leasing terms that you might be  interested in considering. Have an idea of the work load and type  of printing you'll be handling before you go hunting. Talk to  someone who knows what they're doing before you lay down a lot of  cash on a machine.

Duplicators

We prefer duplicators to mimeos even though the price is a  little higher. They work faster, are easier to operate and print  clearer leaflets. The Gestener Silk Screen Duplicator is the best  bet. It turns out stuff almost as good as offset printing. You can  do 10 thousand sheets an hour in an assortment of colors.

Electronic Stencils

If you use electronic stencils you can do solid lettering,  line drawings, cartoons and black and white pictures with good  contrast. To make an electronic stencil, you map out on a sheet of  paper everything you want printed. This is a photo process, so make  sure only what you want printed shows up on the sheet. You can use  a light blue pencil for guide lines as it won't photograph, but be  neat anyway. Printing shops will cut a stencil on a special machine  for about $3.00.

The Gestefax Electronic Stencil Cutter can be leased or rented  in the same way as the duplicator. If you are doing a lot of  printing for a number of different groups, this machine will  eliminate plenty of hassle. The stencils cost about 20¢ each and  take about fifteen minutes to make.

If you have an electronic stencil cutter, duplicator, electric  typewriter and a cheap source of paper, you can do almost any  printing job imaginable. Have a dual rate system: one for community  groups and another for regular business orders. You can use the  profits to go towards the purchasing of more equipment and to build  toward the day when you can get your own offset press.

Silk Screening

Posters banners and shirts that are unbelievable can be  printed by this exciting method. The process is easy to learn and  teach. You'll need a fairly large area to work in since the posters  have to be hung up to dry. Pick up any inexpensive paperback book  on silk screening. The equipment costs less than $50.00 to begin.  Once you get good at it, you can print complicated designs in a  number of different colors, including portraits.

UNDERGROUND NEWSPAPERS

Food conspiracies, bust trusts, people's clinics and  demonstrations are all part of the new Nation, but if asked to name  the most important institution in our lives, one would have to say  the underground newspaper. It keeps tuned in on what's going on in  the community and around the world. Values, myths, symbols, and all  the trappings of our culture are determined to a large extent by  the underground press. Each office serves as a welcome mat for  strangers, a meeting place for community organizers and a rallying  force to fight pig repression. There are probably over 500  regularly publishing with readerships running from a few hundred to  over 500,000. Most were started in the last three years. If your  scene doesn't have a paper, you probably don't have a scene  together. A firmly established paper can be started on about  $2,500. Plan to begin with eight pages in black and white with a  5,000 copy run. Each such issue will cost about $300 to print. You  should have six issues covered when you start. Another $700 will do  for equipment. Offset printing is what you'll want to get from a  commercial printing establishment.

You need some space to start, but don't rush into setting up a  storefront office until you feel the paper's going to be  successful. A garage, barn or spare apartment room will do just  fine. Good overhead fluorescent lighting, a few long tables, a  bookcase, desk, chairs, possibly a phone and you are ready to  start.

Any typewriter will work, but you can rent an IBM Selectric  typewriter with a deposit of $120.00 and payments of $20.00 per  month. Leasing costs twice as much, but you'll own the machine when  the payments are finished. The Selectric has interchangeable type  that works on a ball system rather than the old-fashion keys. Each  ball costs $18.00, so by getting a few you can vary the type the  way a printer does.

A light-table can make things a lot easier when it comes to  layout. Simply build a box (3' x 4' is a good size, but the larger  the better) out of ¸" plywood. The back should be higher than the  front to provide a sloping effect. The top should consist of a  shelf of frosted glass. Get one strong enough to lean on. Inside  the box, attach two fluorescent light fixtures to the walls or  base. The whole light table should cost less than $25.00. That  really is about all you need, except someone with a camera, a few  good writers who will serve as reporters, an artistic person to  take care of layout, and someone to hassle printing deals,  advertising and distribution. Most people start by having everyone  do everything.

Layout

A tabloid size paper is 9 7/8" x 14 5/8" with an inch left  over on each side for margins. Columns typically are 3 1/4"  allowing for three per page. Experience has found that this size is  easy to lay out and more importantly, easy to read. There is an  indirect ratio between readability and academic snobbishness. Avoid  the textbook look. Remember, the New York Times in its low form  represents the Death Kulture.

Start off with a huge collection of old magazines and  newspapers. You can cut up all sorts of letters, borders, designs  and sketches and paste them together to make eye-catching  headlines. Sheets of headline type are available in different  styles from art stores for $1.25 a sheet. Buy one of each type and  then photograph several copies of each, bringing the price way  down. The basic content in the prescribed column size should be  banged out on the IBM. The columns can be clipped together with a  clothespin to avoid confusion. Use a good heavy bond white opaque  paper.

All black and white photographs from newspapers and magazines  can be used directly. Color pictures can also be used but it's  tricky and you'll have to experiment a little to get an  understanding of what colors photograph poorly. Glossy black and  white photographs must be shot in half tones to keep the grey  areas. You can have them processed at any photo lab. You might also  need the photo lab for enlargements or reductions, so make contact  and establish a good working relationship.

An Exacto knife is available for 29¢ and you can get a package  of 100 blades for $10.00. A few metal rulers, a good pair of  scissors, some spray adhesive or rubber cement and you're ready to  paste the pages that will make up the "dummy" that goes to the  printer. Each page is laid out on special layout sheets with faint  blue guide lines that don't photograph. Any large art supply store  sells these sheets and all the other supplies.

By working over a light-table, the paste-up can be done more  professionally. Experiment with many different layouts for each  page before finally pasting up the paper. Don't have a picture in  the corner and the rest solid columns. Print can be run over  pictures and sketches by preparing two sheets for that page and  shooting background in half-tones. The columns don't have to be run  straight up and down, but can run at different angles. The most  newsworthy articles should be towards the front of the paper. The  centerfold can be treated in an exciting manner. A good idea is to  do the centerfold so that it can be used as a poster to put on a  wall after the paper is read. If you have ads, they should be kept  near the back. The masthead, which gives the staff, mailing  address, and similar info, goes near the front. Your focus should  be the local activities. A section should be reserved for a  directly of local services and events. People giving things away  should have a section. The rest really depends on the life style  and politics of the staff.

National stories can be supplied by one or more of the news  services. Nothing in the underground press is copyrighted, so you  can reprint an interesting article from another paper. It's  customary to indicate what paper printed it first, or news service  it was sent out by. Any underground paper has permission to reprint  hunks of this book.

Ads

Most papers find it necessary to get some advertising to help  defray the production costs. Some rely totally on subscription;  some are outgrowths of organizations and still others are printed  up and just handed out free. The ones with ads seem to have the  longest life. Make up an ad rate before you put out the first  issue. Ads are measured in inches of length. The width is  understood by everyone to be the width of the column. If you use  the 3¹" column, however, you'll want to let potential advertisers  know you have wide columns.

The way to arrive at a reasonable rate is to estimate the  total budget for each issue (adding some for overhead and labor),  then each page and finally each column inch. After a little  arithmetic you can get a good estimate of your printing cost per  inch. Using our figures throughout this section, it should come to  about $2.00 per inch. Double this figure and you'll arrive at  the  correct rate per advertising inch-$4.00. There should be special  lower rates for large ads, such as half or full pages. There should  also be a special arrangement for a continuous subscriber. If you  have a classified section, another rate based on number of words or  lines is constructed. A service charge is fixed if you make up the  ad layout rather than the advertiser. The whole formula should be  worked out and printed up before you lay out the first issue.

The best place to get advertising is locally. Theaters, hip  clothing stores, ice cream parlors, and record stores are among the  type of advertisers you should approach. After you build up a  circulation, you might want to seek out national advertisers. The  Underground Press Syndicate, Box 26, Village Station, New York, NY  10014, can be joined for $25.00, no dues thereafter. They try to  get national ads for you in addition to sending out a newsletter, a  news service, and making sure you get free subscriptions to the  other underground papers. The U.P.S. can also do many other things  for you, like list you in their directory, obtain legal advice, and  bring you together with other underground papers for mutual benefit  and defense. Another way to get national advertising is to see who  tends to advertise in other underground papers. Send the publicity  department of these companies letters and samples of your paper.  Never let ads make up more than half the paper.

Distribution

At the beginning you should aim for a bi-weekly paper with a  gradual increase in the number of pages. The price should be about  25¢. Check out the local laws about selling papers on the street.  It's probably allowed and is a neat way to get the paper around.  Give half to the street hawkers. Representatives at high schools  and colleges should be sought out. Bookstores and newsstands are  good places to distribute. After your paper gets going well, you  might try for national distribution. The Cosmep Newsletter is put  out by the Committee of Small Magazines, Editors and Publishers, PO  Box 1425, Buffalo, NY 14214. In addition to good tips if you want  to start a small literary magazine or publish your own book, they  provide an up-to-date list of small stores around the country that  would be likely to carry your paper. Subscriptions should be sought  in the paper itself. If you get a lot, check out second class  mailing privileges. UPS can help with out-of-city distribution.

If you're in a smaller town, you might have to shop around or  go to another city to get printing done. Many printers print only  pig swill, which brings up the point of getting busted for  obscenity which can be pretty common. You probably should  incorporate, but contact a sympathetic lawyer before you put out  your first issue. During the summer there are usually a few  alternative media conferences organized by one group or another.  You can pick up valuable information and exchange ideas at these  gatherings. UPS and the news services will keep you posted. Good  luck and write on!

HIGH SCHOOL PAPERS

The usual high school paper is run by puppet lackeys of the  administration. It avoids controversy, naughty language, and a host  of other things foreign to the 4-H Club members the school is  determined to mass produce. The only thing the staff is good at is  kissing the principal's ass. Let's face it, the aim of a good high  school newspaper should be to destroy the high school. Publishing  and distributing a heavy paper isn't going to earn you the Junior  Chamber of Commerce good citizenship award. You might have to be a  little mysterious about who the staff is until you understand the  ground rules and who controls the ballpark²the people or the  principal.

Many schools do not allow papers to be handed out on the  school premises. These cases are generally won by the newspapers  that take the school to court. You can challenge the rule and make  the administration look like the dinosaurs they are by distributing  sheets of paper with only your logo and the school rule printed. By  gaining outside publicity for the first distribution of the paper,  you might put the administration up tight about clamping down on  you. It might be difficult to explain in civics class when they get  to the freedom of the press stuff. Your paper should have one  purpose in mind²to piss off the principal and radicalize the  students. If you run into problems, seek out a sympathetic lawyer.  You can get a helpful pamphlet from the ACLU, 156 5th Ave.,  New York, NY 10010, called Academic Freedom in the Secondary  Schools" for 25¢.

Tell your lawyer about the most recent (July 10, 1970)  decision of the United States District Court in Connecticut which  ruled that the high school students of Rippowan High School in  Stanford can publish independent newspapers without having the  contents screened in advance by school officials.

The same info for underground papers applies to high school  rags, only the price should be much less if not free. To begin  with, you might just mimeograph the first few issues before trying  photo-offset printing. It is very important to get the readers  behind you in case you have to go to war with the administration in  order to survive. Maintain friendships with above ground reporters,  the local underground paper and radical community groups for  alliances.

G.I. PAPERS

A heavier scene than even the high schools exists in No-No  Land of the military. None-the-less, against incredible odds,  courageous G.I.'s both here and overseas have managed to put out a  number of underground newspapers. If you are a G.I. interested in  starting a paper, the first thing to do is seek out a few buddies  who share your views on the military and arrange a meeting,  preferably off the base. Once you have your group together, getting  the paper published will be no problem. Keeping your staff secret,  you can have one member contact with someone from a G.I. coffee  house, anti-war organization or nearby underground newspaper. This  civilian contact person will be in a position to raise the bread  and arrange the printing and distribution of the paper. You can  write one of the national G.I. newspaper organizations listed at  the end of this section if you are unable to find help locally. The  paper should be printed off the base. Government equipment should  be avoided.

Correspondence and subscriptions can be solicited through the  use of a post office box. Such a box is inexpensive and secret (at  least that's what the G.I. papers now publishing report) from  military snoopers up tight about bad publicity if they get caught  spying. If you are mailing the paper to other G.I.'s use first  class mail and a plain envelope. This is advice to anybody sending  stuff to a G.I. The mail is handled by "lifers" who will report  troublemakers to their C.O. (Commanding Officer) if they notice  anti-war slogans on envelopes or dirty commie rags coming their  way.

You'll want to publish stuff relevant to the lives of the  G:I.'s on your base. News of demonstrations, articles on the war,  racism, counter-culture and vital info on how to bug the higher-ups  and get out of the military service are all good. Get samples of  other newspapers already in operation to get the flavor of writing  that has become popular.

Distributing the paper is really more of a problem than the  publishing. Here you run smack into Catch 22, which says, "no  printed matter may be distributed on a military base without prior  written permission of the commanding officer." No such permit has  been granted in military history. A few court battles have had  limited success and you should go through the formality of  obtaining a permit. Send the first issue of the paper to your C.O.  with a cover letter stating where and when you intend to distribute  the paper on the base. In no part of the application should you  list your names. Have a civilian, preferably a civil liberties  lawyer, sign the declaration of intent. If more info is requested,  go over it with the lawyer before responding, Natch, they're going  to want to know who you are and where you get your bread, but fuck  'em. Whether or not you get a permit or have a successful court  battle is pretty academic. If the military pigs catch you handing  out an underground paper on the base, you're headed for trouble.  Use civilian volunteers from your local peace group in as many  public roles as possible. They'll be glad to help out.

Print and distribute as many copies as you can rather than  concentrating on an expensively printed paper with numerous pages.  The very existence of the paper around the base is the most  important info the paper can offer. Leave some in mess halls,  theaters, benches, washrooms, and other suitable spots. Off base  get the paper to sympathetic reporters, coffee houses, colleges and  the like. Outside U.S.O. centers and bus terminals are a good place  to get the paper out. Rely on donations, so you can make the paper  free. Get it together. Demand the right to join the army of your  choice. The People's Army! As Joe Hill said in one of his songs,  "Yes, I'll pick up a gun but I won't guarantee which way I'll point  it."

NEWS SERVICES

Aside from UPS, which is the association of papers, there are  five news services that we know of that you might be interested in  subscribing to for national stories, photos, production ideas, news  of other papers and general movement dope. LNS is the best known.  It sends out packets once a week that include about thirty pages  with original articles, eye-witness reports, reprints from foreign  papers and photographs. They tend to be heavily political rather  than cultural and view themselves as molders of ideology rather  than strictly a service organization of the underground papers. A  subscription costs $15.00 per month, but if you're just starting  out they are good about slow payments and such.

You should get in the habit of sending special articles, in  particular eye-witness accounts of events that other papers might  use, to one or more of the news services for distribution. If you  hear of an important event that you would like to cover in your  newspaper, call the paper in that area for a quick report. They  might send you photos if you agree to reciprocate.

SWITCHBOARDS

A good way to quickly communicate what's coming down in the  community is to build a telephone tree. It works on a pyramid  system. A small core of people are responsible for placing five  calls each. Each person on the line in turn calls five people and  so on. If the system is prearranged correctly with adjustments made  if some people don't answer the phone, you can have info  transmitted to about a thousand people in less than an hour. A  slower but more permanent method is to start a Switchboard.  Basically, a Switchboard is a central telephone number or numbers  that anybody can call night or day to get information. It can be as  sophisticated as the community can support. The people that agree  to answer the phone should have a complete knowledge of places,  services and events happening in the community. Keep a complete  updated file. The San Francisco Switchboard (see below) puts out an  operator's manual explaining the organization and operation of a  successful switchboard. They will send it out for 12¢ postage. San  Francisco has the longest and most extensive Switchboard operation.  From time to time there are national conferences with local  switchboards sending a rep.

Guerrilla Broadcasting

GUERRILLA RADIO

Under FCC Low Power Transmission Regulations, it is legal to  broadcast on the AM band without even obtaining a license, if you  transmit with 100 milliwatts of power or less on a free band space  that doesn't interfere with a licensed station. You are further  allowed up to a 12-foot antenna or the use of carrier-current  transmission (regular electric wall outlets). Using this legal  set-up, you can broadcast from a 2 to 20 block radius depending on  how high up you can locate your antenna and the density of tall  buildings in the area.

Carrier-current broadcasting consists of plugging the  transmitter into a regular wall socket. It draws power in the same  way as any other electrical appliance, and feeds its signal into  the power line allowing the broadcast to be heard on any AM radio  tuned into the operating frequency. The transmitter can be adjusted  to different frequencies until a clear band is located. The signal  will travel over the electrical wiring until it hits a transformer  where it will be erased. The trouble with this method is that in  large cities, almost every large office or apartment building has a  transformer. You should experiment with this method first, but if  you are in a city, chances are you'll need an antenna rigged up on  the roof. Anything over twelve feet is illegal, but practice has  shown that the FCC won't hassle you if you don't have commercials  and refrain from interfering with licensed broadcasts. There are  some cats in Connecticut broadcasting illegally with a 100-foot  antenna over a thirty mile radius for hours on end and nobody gives  them any trouble. Naturally if you insist upon using dirty  language, issuing calls to revolution, broadcasting bombing  information, interfering with above ground stations and becoming  too well known, the FCC is going to try and knock you out. There  are penalties that have never been handed out of up to a year in  jail. It's possible you could get hit with a conspiracy rap, which  could make it a felony, but the opinion of movement lawyers now is  a warning if you're caught once, and a possible fine with stiffer  penalties possible for repeaters that are caught.

If it gets really heavy, you could still broadcast for up to  15 minutes without being pin-pointed by the FCC sleuths. By  locating your equipment in a panel truck and broadcasting from a  fixed roof antenna, you can make it almost impossible for them to  catch you by changing positions.

There has been a variety of transmitting equipment used, and  the most effective has been found to be an AM transmitter  manufactured by Low Power Broadcasting Co., 520 Lincoln Highway,  Frazer, Penn. 19355. Call Dick Crompton at (215 NI 4-4096. The  right transmitter will run about $200. If you plan to use  carrier-current transmission you'll also need a capacitor that  sells for $30. An antenna can be made out of aluminum tubing and  antenna wiring available at any TV radio supply store (see  diagram). You'll also need a good microphone that you can get for  about $10. Naturally, equipment for heavier broadcasting is  available if a member of your group has a license or good  connections with someone who works in a large electronics supply  house. Also with a good knowledge in the area you can build a  transmitter for a fraction of the purchase price. You can always  employ tape recorders, turntables and other broadcasting hardware  depending on how much bread you have, how much stuff you have to  hide (i.e., how legal your operation is) and the type of  broadcasting you want to do.

It is possible to extend your range by sending a signal over  the telephone lines to other transmitters which will immediately  rebroadcast. Several areas in a city could be linked together and  even from one city to another. Theoretically, if enough people rig  up transmitters and antennas at proper locations and everyone  operates on the same band, it is possible to build a nation-wide  people's network that is equally theoretically legal.

Broadcasting, it should be remembered, is a one-way  transmission of information. Communications which allow you to  transmit and receive are illegal without a license (ham radio).

GUERRILLA TELEVISION

There are a number of outlaw radio projects going on around  the country. Less frequent, but just as feasible, is a people's  television network. Presently there are three basic types of TV  systems: Broadcast, which is the sending of signals directly from a  station's transmitter to home receiver sets; Cable, where the cable  company employees extremely sensitive antenna to pick up broadcast  transmissions and relay them and/or they originate and send them;  and thirdly, Closed Circuit TV, such as the surveillance cameras in  supermarkets, banks and apartment house lobbies.

The third system as used by the pigs is of little concern,  unless we are interested in not being photographed. The cameras can  be temporarily knocked out of commission by flashing a bright light  (flashbulb, cigarette lighter, etc.) directly in front of its lens.  For our own purposes, closed-circuit TV can be employed for  broadcasting rallies, rock concerts or teach-ins to other  locations. The equipment is not that expensive to rent and easy to  operate. Just contact the largest television or electronics store  in your area and ask about it. There are also closed-circuit and  cable systems that work in harmony to broadcast special shows to  campuses and other institutions. Many new systems are being  developed and will be in operation soon.

Cable systems as such are in use only in a relatively few  areas. They can be tapped either at the source or at any point  along the cable by an engineer freak who knows what to do. The  source is the best spot, since all the amplification and  distribution equipment of the system is available at that point.  Tapping along the cable itself can be a lot hairier, but more  frustrating for the company when they try to trace you down.

Standard broadcasting that is received on almost all living  room sets works on an RF (radio frequency) signal sent out on  various frequencies which correspond to the channels on the tuner.  In no area of the country are all these channels used. This raises  important political questions as to why people do not have the  right to broadcast on unused channels. By getting hold of a TV  camera (Sony and Panasonic are the best for the price) that has an  RF output, you can send pictures to a TV set simply by placing the  camera cable on or near the antenna of the receiver set. When the  set is operating on the same channel as the camera, it will show  what the camera sees. Used video tape recorders such as the Sony CV  series that record and play back audio and video information are  becoming more available. These too can be easily adapted to send RF  signals the same as a live camera.

Whether or not the program to be broadcasted is live or on  tape, there are three steps to be taken in order to establish a  people's TV network. First, you must convert the video and audio  signals to an RF frequency modulated (FM) signal corresponding to  the desired broadcast channel. We suggest for political and  technical reasons that you pick one of the unused channels in your  area to begin experimenting. The commercial stations have an  extremely powerful signal and can usually override your small  output. Given time and experience you might want to go into direct  competition with the big boys on their own channel. It is entirely  possible, say in a 10 to 20 block radius, to interrupt a  presidential press-conference with more important news. Electronic  companies, such as Jerrold Electronics Corp., 4th and Walnut Sts.,  Philadelphia, Pa., make equipment that can RF both video and audio  information onto specific channels. The device you'd be interested  in is called a cable driver or RF modulator.

When the signal is in the RF state, it is already possible to  broadcast very short distances. The second step is to amplify the  signal so it will reach as far as possible. A linear amplifier of  the proper frequency is required for this job. The stronger the  amplifier the farther and more powerful the signal. A 10-watt job  will cover approximately 5 miles (line of sight) in area. Linear  amplifiers are not that easily available, but they can be  constructed with some electrical engineering knowledge.

The third step is the antenna, which if the whole system is to  be mobile to avoid detection, is going to involve some  experimentation and possible camouflage. Two things to keep in mind  about an antenna are that it should be what is technically referred  to as a "di-pole" antenna (see diagram) and since TV signals travel  on line of sight, it is important to place the antenna as high as  possible. Although it hasn't been done in practice, it certainly is  possible to reflect pirate signals off an make equipment that can  RF both video and audio existing antenna of a commercial network.  This requires a full knowledge of broadcasting; however, any  amateur can rig up an antenna, attach it to a helium balloon and  get it plenty high. For most, the roof of a tall building will  suffice. If you're really uptight about your operation, the antenna  can be hidden with a fake cardboard chimney.We realize becoming TV guerrillas is not everyone's trip, but  a small band with a few grand can indeed pull it off. There are a  lot of technical freaks hanging around recording studios, guitar  shops, hi-fi stores and engineering schools that can be turned on  to the project. By showing them the guidelines laid out here, they  can help you assemble and build various components that are  difficult to purchase (i.e., the linear amplifier). Naturally, by  building some of the components, the cost of the operation is kept  way down. Equipment can be purchased in selective electronics  stores. You'll need a camera, VTR, RF modulator, linear amplifier  and antenna. Also a generator, voltage regulator and an alternator  if you want the station to be mobile. One of the best sources of  information on both television and radio broadcasting is the Radio  Amateur's Handbook published by the American Radio Relay League,  Newington, Conn. 06611 and available for $4.50. The handbook gives  a complete course in electronics and the latest information on all  techniques and equipment related to broadcasting. Back issues have  easy to read do-it-yourself TV transmitter diagrams and  instructions. Also available is a publication called Radical  Software, put out by Raindance Corp., 24 E. 22nd St., New York,  N.Y., with the latest info on all types of alternative  communications.

Guerrilla TV is the vanguard of the communications revolution,  rather than the avant-garde cellophane light shows and the weekend  conferences. One pirate picture on the sets in Amerika's living  rooms is worth a thousand wasted words.

With the fundamentals in this field mastered, you can rig up  all sorts of shit. Cheap twenty-dollar tape recorders can be  purchased and outfitted with a series of small loud-speakers.  Concealed in a school auditorium or other large hall, such a system  can blast out any message or music you wish to play. The  administration will go insane trying to locate the operation if it  is well hidden. We know two cats who rigged a church with this type  of setup and a timing device. Right in the middle of the sermon, on  came Radio Heaven and said stuff like "Come on preacher, this is  God, you don't believe all that crap now, do you?" It made for an  exciting Sunday service, all right. You can build a miniature  transmitter and with a small magnet attach it to the underbelly of  a police car to keep track of where it's going. This would only be  practical in a small town or on a campus where there are only a few  security guards or patrol vehicles. If you rigged a small tape  recorder to the transmitter and tuned it to a popular AM band, the  patrol car as it rode around could actually broadcast the guerrilla  message you prerecorded. Wouldn't they be surprised when they found  out how you did it? You can get a "Bumper Beeper" and receiver that  are constructed by professionals for use by private detectives. The  dual unit costs close to $400. If you've got that kind of bread,  you can write John Bomar, 6838 No. 3rd Ave., Phoenix, Arizona 85013  for a catalogue and literature.

Even though there are laws governing the area of sneaky  surveillance, telephone taps, tracking devices and the like, a  number of enterprising firms produce an unbelievable array of  electronic hardware that allows you to match Big Brother's ears and  eyes. Sugar cube transmitters, tie clasp microphones, phone taps,  tape recorders that work in a hollowed-out book and other Brave New  World equipment is available from the following places. Send for  their catalogues just to marvel at the level of technology.  R. B. Clifton, 1150 NW 7th Ave., Miami, Fla. 33168; Electrolab  Corp., Bank of Stateboro Building, Stateboro, Ga. 30458; or Tracer  Investigative Products, Inc., 256 Worth. Ave., Palm, Beach, Fla.  33482.

By the way, you can pick up Radio Hanoi on a short wave radio  every day from 3:00 to 3:30 PM at 15013 kilocycles on the 19 meter  band.

Demonstrations

Demonstrations always will be an important form of protest.  The structure can vary from a rally or teach-in to a massive civil  disobedience such as the confronting of the warmakers at the  Pentagon or a smoke-in. A demonstration is different from other  forms of warfare because it invites people other than those  planning the action via publicity to participate. It also is  basically non-violent in nature. A complete understanding of the  use of media is necessary to create the publicity needed to get the  word out. Numbers of people are only one of the many factors in an  effective demonstration. The timing, choice of target and tactics  to be employed are equally important. There have been  demonstrations of 400,000 that are hardly remembered and  demonstrations of a few dozen that were remarkably effective. Often  the critical element involved is the theater. Those who say a  demonstration should be concerned with education rather than  theater don't understand either and will never organize a  successful demonstration, or for that matter, a successful  revolution. Publicity includes everything from buttons and leaflets  to press conferences. You should be in touch with the best artists  you can locate to design the visual props. Posters can be silk  screened very cheaply and people can be taught to do it in a very  short time. Buttons have to be purchased. The cheapest are those  printed directly on the metal. The paint rubs off after a while,  but they are ideal for mass demonstrations. You can print 10,000  for about $250.00. Leaflets, like posters, should be well designed.

One way of getting publicity is to negotiate with the city for  permits. Again, this raises political questions, but there is not  doubt one reason for engaging in permit discussions is for added  publicity.

The date, time and place of the demonstration all have to be  chosen with skill. Know the projected weather reports. Pick a time  and day of the week that are convenient to most people. Make sure  the place itself adds some meaning to the message. Don't have a  demonstration just because that's the way it's always been done. It  is only one type of weapon and should be used as such. On the other  hand, don't dismiss demonstrations because they have always turned  out boring. You and your group can plan a demonstration within the  demonstration more accurately. Also don't tend to dismiss  demonstrations outright because the repression is too great. During  World War II the Danes held street demonstrations against the Nazis  who occupied their country. Even today there are public  demonstrations against the Vietnam War in downtown Saigon.  Repression is there, but overestimating it is more a tactical  blunder than the reverse. None the less, it's wise to go to all  demonstrations prepared for a vamping by the pigs.

DRESS

Most vamping is accompanied by clubbing, rough shoving and  dragging, gassing and occasional buckshot or rifle fire. The  clothing you wear should offer you the best protection possible,  yet be light weight enough to allow you to be highly mobile. CS and  CN are by far the most commonly employed tear gas dispersibles.  Occasionally they are combined with pepper gas to give better  results. Pepper gas is a nerve irritant that affects exposed areas  of the skin. Clothing that is tight fitting and covers as much of  the body surface as possible is advisable. This also offers some  protection if you are dragged along the ground. Gloves come in  handy as protection and if you want to pick up gas canisters and  throw them back at the pigs or chuck them through a store window.

Your shoes should be high sneakers for running or boots for  kicking. Hiking boots sold in army surplus stores serve both  purposes and are your best selection for street action. Men should  wear a jock strap or protective cup. Rib guards can be purchased  for about $6.00 at any sporting goods store. Shoulder pads and leg  pads are also available, but unless you expect heavy fighting and  are used to wearing this clumsy street armor, you'll be better off  without it.

HELMETS

Everyone should have a helmet. Your head sticks out above the  swarming crowd and dents like a tin can. Protect it! The type of  helmet you get depends on what you can afford and how often you'll  be using it. The cheapest helmet available is a heavy steel tank  model. This one is good because it offers ear protection and has a  built-in suspension system to absorb the blow. It is also bullet  proof. It's disadvantages are that it only comes in large sizes and  is the heaviest thing you'll ever have on your head. It costs about  $3.00. For $5.00 you can get a Civil Defense helmet made for  officers. It's much lighter, but doesn't offer protection for the  ears. It has a good suspension system. If you get this model, paint  it a dark color before using it and you'll be less conspicuous. Our  fashion consultants suggest anarchy black.

Construction helmets or "hard hats" run between $8.00 and  $10.00, depending on the type of suspension system and material  used. They are good for women because they are extremely  lightweight. The aluminum ones dent if struck repeatedly and the  fiberglass type can crack. Also they offer no ear protection. If  you prefer one of these you should find a way to attach a chin or  neck strap so you won't lose it while you run. If you get a hard  hat, make sure you remove the hard head before you take it home.

Probably the all-around good deal for the money is the  standard M-1 Army issue helmet. These vary in quality and price,  depending on age and condition. They run from $2.00 to $10.00.  Make sure the one you get has a liner with webbing that fits well  or is adjustable and has a chin strap. Their main disadvantage is  that they are bulky and heavy.

The snappiest demonstrators use the familiar motorcycle crash  helmet. They are the highest in price, running from $10.00 to as  high as $40.00. Being made of fiberglass, they are extremely  lightweight. They have a heavy-duty strap built in and they can be  gotten to fit quite snugly around the head. They offer excellent  ear protection. The foam rubber insulation is better than a webbing  system, and will certainly cushion most blows. Being made of  fiberglass, a few have been known to crack under repeated blows,  but that is extremely rare. Most come with plastic face guards that  offer a little added protection. Get only those with removable ones  since you might want to make use of a gas mask.

GAS MASKS

Ski goggles or the face visor on a crash helmet will protect  against Mace but will offer no protection against the chemical  warfare gasses being increasingly used by pigs to dispose crowds.  For this protection you'll need a gasmask. All the masks discussed  give ideal protection against the gasses mentioned in the chart if  used properly. If you do not have a gas mask, you should at least  get a supply of surgical masks from a hospital supply store and a  plastic bag filled with water and a cloth.

The familiar World War II Army gas mask with the filter in a  long nose unit sells new (which is the only way gas masks can be  sold) for about $5.00. Its disadvantages are that it doesn't cover  the whole face, is easy to grab and pull off and the awkwardly  placed filter makes running difficult. The Officer Civil Defense  unit sells for the same price and overcomes the disadvantages of  the World War II Army model. Most National Guard units use this  type of mask. It offers full face protection, is lightweight and  the filter canister is conveniently located. Also the adjustable  straps make for a nice tight fit. The U.S.A. Protective Field  Combat Mask M9A1 offers the same type protection as the OCD, but  costs twice as much. Its advantage is that you can get new filter  canisters when the chemicals in the one you are using becomes  ineffective. New filters cost about $1.50. When you buy a mask, be  sure and inquire if the filter has replacements. To get maximum  efficiency out of a mask it needs an active chemical filter.

The U.S. Navy ND Mark IV Mask is the most effective gas mask  available. It has replaceable filter canisters and fits snugly to  the head. It costs about $12.00. Its disadvantage is its dual tube  filter system, which is somewhat bulky. Fix it so the canister  rests on the back of your needs. It's more difficult to grab and  easier to run.

When you get your gas mask home, try it out to get the feeling  of using it. Make sure the fit is good and snug. Purchase an  anti-fog cloth for 25 cents where you got the mask. Wipe the inside  of the eye pieces before wearing to prevent the glasses from  clouding. Another good reason for wearing a mask is that it offers  anonymity. Helmets, gas masks and a host of other valuable  equipment are available at any large Army-Navy surplus store.  Kaufman's Surplus and Arms, Inc., 623 Broadway, New York, N.Y.  10012 is very well stocked. For 75 cents you can get their  catalogue and order through the mail. It's in New York though and  probably more expensive than a store in your locale. The surplus  stores buy from wholesale distributors themselves, who in turn buy  directly from the military. If you know a soldier or someone who is  married to a soldier, they have access to the Post Dispensary or PX  and can get all sorts of stuff at nothing prices. For 20 cents you  can get an  invaluable pamphlet from the Government Printing Office  called How to Buy Surplus Personal Property. It has a complete list  of regional surplus wholesalers. The closest one in the Northeast  is the Naval Supply Center, Building 652, U.S. Naval Base,  Philadelphia, Pa. and in Northern California, the Naval Supply  Center, Building 502, Oakland, California. You can order by mail or  in person and the prices are very low, even though it isn't as good  as the stuff our brothers and sisters in the Viet Cong rip-off.

WALKIE-TALKIES

You should always go to a demonstration in a small group that  stays in contact with each other until the demonstration is over.  One way to keep in touch is to use walkie-talkies. No matter how  heavy the vamping gets or how spread out are the crowds, you'll be  able to communicate with these lightweight effective portable  devices. The only disadvantage is cost. A half decent unit costs at  least $18.00. It should have a minimum of 9 transistors and 100  milliwatts, although walkie-talkies can go as high as 5 watts and  broadcast over 2 miles. Anything under 1 watt will not broadcast  over ¸ mile and considerably less in an area with tall buildings.  The best unit you can buy runs about $300.00. If you ever deck a  pig, steal his walkie-talkie even before you take his gun. A good  rule is to avoid the bargain gyp-joints and go to a place that  deals in electronic equipment.

The important thing to realize about all walkie-talkie  networks is that if anyone can talk, anyone else can listen and  vice versa. This applies to pigs as well as us. All walkie-talkies  work on the Civilian Band which has 23 channels. The cheaper units  are preset to channel 9 or 11. The pigs broadcast on higher  channels, usually channel 22. More expensive sets can operate on  alternative channels. By removing the front of the set, you can  adjust the transmitter and receiver to pick up and receive police  communications. Don't screw around with the inside though, unless  you know what you are doing. Allied Radio, 100 N. Western Ave.,  Chicago, Illinois 60680, will send you a good free catalogue, as  will most large electronic stores. Consider buying a number of sets  and ask about group discounts. Practice a number of times before  you actually use walkie-talkies in real action. Develop code names  and words just like the pigs do. Once you get acquainted with this  method of communications in the streets, you'll never get cut off  from the action. Watch out in close combat though. The pigs always  try to smash any electronic gear.

OTHER EQUIPMENT

A sign can be used to ward off blows. Staple it to a good  strong pole that you can use as a weapon if need be. Chains make  good belts, as do garrisons with the buckles sharpened. A tightly  rolled-up magazine or newspaper also can be used as a defensive  weapon.

Someone in your group should carry a first aid kit. A Medical  Emergency Aeronautic Kit, which costs about $5.00 has a perfect  carrying bag for street action.

Ideally you should visit the proposed site of the  demonstration before it actually takes place. This way you'll have  an idea of the terrain and the type of containment the police will  be using. Someone in your group should mimeograph a map of the  immediate vicinity which each person should carry. Alternative  actions and a rendezvous point should be worked out. Everyone  should have two numbers written on their arm, a coordination center  number and the number of a local lawyer or legal defense committee.  You should not take your personal phone books to demonstrations. If  you get busted, pigs can get mighty Nosy when it comes to phone  books. Any sharp objects can be construed as weapons. Women should  not wear earrings or other jewelry and should tie their hair up to  tuck it under a helmet. Wear a belt that you can use as a  tourniquet. False teeth and contact lenses should be left at home  if possible. You can choke on false teeth if you receive a sharp  blow while running. Contact lenses can complicate eye damage if gas  or Mace is used.

If it really looks heavy, you might want to pick up on a  lightweight adjustable bullet-proof vest, available for $14.95 from  Surplus Distributors, Inc., 6279 Van Nuys Blvd., Van Nuys,  California 91401. Remember what the Boy Scouts say when they go  camping: "Be Prepared". When you go to demonstrations you should be  prepared for a lot more than speeches. The pigs will be.

Trashing

Ever since the Chicago pigs brutalized the demonstrators in  August of 1968, young people have been read to vent their rage over  Amerika's inhumanity by using more daring tactics than basic  demonstrations. There is a growing willingness to do battle with  the pigs in the streets and at the same time to inflict property  damage. It's not exactly rioting and it's not exactly guerrilla  warfare; it has come to be called "Trashing." Most trashing is of a  primitive nature with the pigs having the weapon and strategy  advantage. Most trashers rely on quick young legs and a nearby  rock. By developing simple gang strategy and becoming acquainted  with some rudimentary weapons and combat techniques, the odds can  be shifted considerably.

Remember, pigs have small brains and move slowly. All  formations, signals, codes and other procedures they use have to be  uniform and simplistic. The Army Plan for Containment and Control  of Civil Disorders, published by the Government Printing Office,  contains the basic thinking for all city, county and state storm  troopers. A trip to the library and a look at any basic text in  criminology will help considerably in gaining an understanding of  how pigs act in the street. If you study up, you'll find you can,  with the aid of a bullhorn or properly adjusted walkie-talkie, fuck  up many intricate pig formations. "Left flank-right turn!" said  authoritatively into a bullhorn pointed in the right direction will  yield all sorts of wild results.

You should trash with a group using a buddy system to keep  track of each other. If someone is caught by a pig, other should  immediately rush to the rescue if it's possible to do so without  sustaining too many losses. If an arrest is made, someone from your  gang should take responsibility for seeing to it that a lawyer and  bail bread are taken care of. Never abandon a member of your gang.

Avoid fighting in close quarters. You run less risk by  throwing an object than by personally delivering the blow with a  weapon you hold in your hand. We suppose this is what pigs refer to  as "duty fighting." All revolutionaries fight dirt in the eyes of  the oppressors. The British accused the Minutemen of Lexington and  Concord of fighting dirty by hiding behind trees. The U.S. Army  accuses the Viet Cong of fighting dirty when they rub a pointed  bamboo shoot in infected shit and use it as a land mine. Mayor  Daley says the Yippies squirted hair spray and used golf balls with  spikes in them against his innocent blue boys. No one ever accused  the U.S. of being sneaky for using an airforce in Southeast Asia or  the Illinois State Attorney's office of fighting dirty when it  murdered Fred Hampton and Mark Clark while they lay in bed. We say:  all power to the dirty fighters!

WEAPONS FOR STREET FIGHTING

Spray Cans

These are a very effective and educating method of property  destruction. If a liberated zone has been established or you find  yourself on a quiet street away from the thick of things, pretty up  the neighborhood. Slogans and symbols can be sprayed on rough  surfaces such as brick or concrete walls that are a real bitch to  remove unless expensive sandblasting is used.

The Slingshot

This is probably the ideal street weapon for the swarms of  little Davids that are out to down the Goliaths of Pigdom. It is  cheap, legal to carry, silent, fast-loading and any right size rock  will do for a missile. You can find them at hobby shops and large  sporting goods stores, especially those that deal in hunting  supplies. Wrist-Rocket makes a powerful and accurate slingshot for  $2.50. The Whamo Sportsman is not as good but half the price. By  selecting the right "Y" shaped branch, you can fashion a home-made  one by using a strip of rubber cut from the inner tube of a tue as  the sling. A few hours of shooting stones at cans in the back yard  or up on the roof will make you marksman enough for those fat bank  windows and even fatter pigs.

Slings

A sling is a home-made weapon consisting of two lengths of  heavy-duty cord each attached securely at one end to a leather  patch that serves as a pocket to cradle the rock. Place the rock in  the pouch and grab the two pieces of cord firmly in your hand.  Whirl the rock round and round until gravity holds it firmly in the  pouch. When you feel you have things under control, let one end of  the cord go and the rock will fly out at an incredible speed. You  should avoid using the sling in a thick crowd (rooftop shooting is  best). Practice is definitely needed to gain any degree of  accuracy.

Boomerangs

The boomerang is a neat weapon for street fighting and is as  easy to master as the Frisbee. There is a great psychological  effect in using exotic weapons such as this. You can buy one at  large hobby stores. On the East Coast you can get one from  Sportscraft, Bergenfield, New Jersey, for $2.69, and on the West  Coast from Whamo, 835 El Monte St., San Gabriel, Calif., for $1.10.

Flash Guns

Electric battery-operated flash guns are available that will  blind a power-crazy pig, thus distracting him long enough to rescue  a captured comrade. Check out camping and boating supply stores.

Tear Gas and Mace

Personalized tear gas and mace dispensers are available for  self-defense against muggers. Well, isn't a pig just an extra  vicious mugger? Write J.P. Darby, 8813 New Hyde Park, New York,  N.Y. 11040 for a variety of types and prices.

Tear gas shells are available for 12 gauge shotguns and .38  Special handguns, but it is highly inadvisable to bring guns to  street actions. A far better weapon is a specially built projection  device that shoots tear gas shells. Hercules Gas-Munitions Corp.,  5501 No. Broadway, Chicago, Ill., sells compact units complete with  cartridges for $6.95 that will fire up to 20 feet. Penguin  Associates, Inc., Pennsylvania Avenue, Malvern, Penn., also has a  variety of tear-gas propellant devices including a combination tear  gas-billyclub item. All these companies will supply a catalogue and  price list on request. Some states have laws against civilian use  of tear gas devices. New York is one of them, and unfortunately  these companies will not ship to states that forbid usage. If you  want any of these items, and your state has restrictions, have a  sister or brother in a neighboring state order for you. Just  latching onto these catalogues can be a trip and a half in terms of  getting your imagination hopping. For example Raid, Black Flag and  other insecticides shoot a 7 to 10 foot stream that burns the eyes.  You can also dissolve Drano in water and squirt it from an ordinary  plastic water pistol. That makes a highly effective defensive  weapon. A phony letterhead of a Civil Defense unit will help in  getting heavier anti-personal weapons of a defensive nature.

Anti-Tire Weapons

Don't believe all those bullshit tire ads that make tires seem  like the Superman of the streets. Roofing nails spread out on the  street are effective in stopping a patrol car. A nail sticking out  from a strong piece of wood wedged under a rear tire will work as  effectively as a bazooka. An ice pick will do the trick repeatedly  but you've got to have a strong arm to strike home. Sugar in the  gas tank of a pig vehicle will really fuck-up the engine.

Authentic Pig Game

If you really get into it, you'll probably want to be sd  heavily prepared for trashing as are the pigs. Wouldn't you just  know that the largest supplier of equipment to police in the world  is in Chicago. Kale's, 550 W. Roosevelt Rd., Chicago, Ill. 60607,  will send you, on request, the most complete catalogue you can get  for trashing. Actual police uniforms, super-riot helmets,  persuaders chemical mace, a knuckle sap, which is a glove with  powdered lead, billy clubs, secret holsters, a three-in-one mob  stick that spits Mace, emits an electric shock and allows you to  club to death a charging rhinoceros. You can also get the latest in  handcuffs and other security devices. This catalogue is a must for  the love-child of the 70's. If we want to get high we're going to  have to fight our way up.

KNIFE FIGHTING

Probably one of the most favored street weapons of all time is  the good old "shiv," "blade," "toe-jabber" or whatever you choose  to call a good sticker. Remembering that today's pig is tomorrow's  bacon, it's good to know a few handy slicing tips. The first thing  to learn is the local laws regarding the possession of knives. The  laws on possession are of the "Catch-22" vagueness. Cops can arrest  you for having a small pocket knife and claim you have a concealed  and deadly weapon in your possession. Here, as in most cases of  law, it's not what you are doing, it's who's doing the what that  counts. All areas, however, usually have a limit on length such as  blades under 4" or 6" are legal and anything over that length  concealed on a person can be considered illegal. Asking some hip  lawyers can help here.

Unfortunately, the best fighting knives are illegal.  Switchblades (and stilettos) because they can so quickly spring  into operation, are great weapons that are outlawed in all states.  If you want to risk the consequences, however, you can readily  purchase these weapons once you learn how to contact the criminal  underworld or in most foreign countries. If both of these fail, go  to any pawnshop, look in the window, and take our choice of lethal,  illegal knives.

A flat gravity knife, available in most army surplus and pawn  shops would be the best type available in regular over-the-counter  buying. It's flat style makes for easy concealment and comfort when  kept in a pocket or boot. It can be greased and the rear "heel" of  the blade can be filed down to make it fly open with a flick of the  wrist. A little practice here will be very useful.

Most inexperienced knife fighters use a blade incorrectly.  Having seen too many Jim Bowies slash their way through walls of  human flesh, they persist in carrying on this inane tradition.  Overhead and uppercut slashes are a waste of energy and blade  power. The correct method is to hold the knife in a natural, firm  grip and jab straight ahead at waist level with the arm extending  full length each time. This fencing style allows for the maximum  reach of arm and blade. By concentrating the point of the knife  directly at the target, you make defense against such an attack  difficult. Work out with this jabbing method in front of a mirror  and in a few days you'll get it down pretty well.

UNARMED DEFENSE

Let's face it, when it comes to trashing in the streets, our  success is going to depend on our cunning and speed rather than our  strength and power. Our side is all quarterbacks, and the pigs have  nothing but linemen. They are clumsy, slobbish brutes that would be  lost without their guns, clubs and toy whistles. When one grabs you  for an arrest, you can with a little effort, make him let go. In  the confusion of all the street action, you will then be able to  manage your getaway.

There are a variety of defensive twists and pulls that are  easy to master by reading a good, easily understandable book on the  subject, such as George Hunter's How To Defend Yourself (see  appendix). If a pig grabs you by the wrist you can break the grip  by twisting against his thumb. Try this on yourself by grabbing one  wrist with your hand. See how difficult it is to hold someone who  works against the thumb. If he grabs you around the waist or neck,  you can grab his thumbs or another finger and sharply bend it  backwards. By concentrating all your energy on one little finger,  you can inflict pain and cause the grip to be broken.

There are a variety of points on the body where a firm amount  of pressure skillfully directed will induce severe pain. A grip,  for example, can be broken by jabbing your finger firmly between  the pig's knuckles. (Nothing like chopped pigknuckles.) Feel  directly under your chin in back of the jawbone until your finger  rests in the V area, press firmly upward and backward towards the  center of the head. There is also a very vulnerable spot right  behind the ear lobe. Stick your fingers there and see. Get the  point!

In addition to pressure points, there are places in the body  where a sharp, well-directed whack with the side of a rigidly held  palm can easily disable a person. Performed by an expert, such a  blow can even be lethal. Try making such a rigid palm and practice  these judo chops. The fist is a ridiculous weapon to use. It's  fleshy, the blow is distributed over too wide an area to have any  real effect and the knuckles break easily. You will have to train  yourself to use judo chops instinctively, but it will prove quite  worthwhile if you are ever in trouble. A good place to aim for is  directly in the center of the chest cavity at its lowest point.  Draw a straight line up about six inches starting from your belly  button, and you can feel the point. The Adam's Apple in the center  of the neck and the back of the neck at the top of the spinal  column are also extremely vulnerable spots. With the side of your  palm, press firmly the spot directly below your nose and above your  upper lip. You can easily get an idea of what a short, forceful  chop in this area would do. The side of the head in front of the  ear is also a good place to aim your blow.

In addition to jabs, chops, twists, squeezes and bites, you  ought to gain some mastery of kneeing and kicking. If you are being  held in close and facing the porker, the old familiar  knee-in-the-nuts will produce remarkable results. A feinting motion  with the head before the knee is delivered will produce a reflexive  reaction from your opponent that will leave his groin totally  unprotected. Ouch!

Whether he has you from the front or the back, he is little  prepared to defend against a skillfully aimed kick. The best way is  to forcefully scrape the side of your shoe downward along the  shinbone, beginning just below the knee and ending with a hard  stomp on the instep of the foot. Just try this with the side of  your hand and you will get an idea of the damage you can inflict  with this scrape and stomp method. Another good place to kick and  often the only spot accessible is the side of the knee. Even a half  successful blow here will topple the biggest of honkers. Any of  these easy to learn techniques of unarmed self defense will fulfill  the old nursery rhyme that goes:

Catch a piggy by the toe
When he hollers
Let him go
Out pops Y-0-U

GENERAL STRATEGY RAP

The guideline in trashing is to try and do as much property  destruction as possible without getting caught or hurt. The best  buildings to trash in terms of not alienating too many of those not  yet clued into revolutionary violence, are the most piggy symbols  of violence you can find. Banks, large corporations, especially  those that participate heavily in supporting the U.S. armed forces,  federal buildings, courthouses, police stations, and Selective  Service centers are all good targets. On campuses, buildings that  are noted for warfare research and ROTC training are best. When it  comes to automobiles, choose only police vehicles and very  expensive cars such as Lamborghinis and Iso Grifos. Every rock or  molotov cocktail thrown should make a very obvious political point.  Random violence produces random propaganda results. Why waste even  a rock?

When you know there is going to be a rough street scene  developing, don't play into the pig's strategy. Spread the action  out. Help waste the enemy's numbers. You and the other members of  your group should already have a target or two in mind that will  make for easy trashing. If you don't have one, setting fires in  trash cans and ringing fire alarms will help provide a cover for  other teams that do have objectives picked out. Putting out street  lights with rocks also helps the general infusion.

After a few tries at trashing, you'll begin to overcome your  fears, learn what to expect from both the pigs and your comrades,  and develop your own street strategy. Nothing works like practice  in actual street conditions. Get your head together and you'll  become a pro. Don't make the basic mistake of just naively floating  into the area. Don't think "rally" or "demonstration," think "WAR"  and "Battle Zone." Keep your eyes and ears open. Watch for mistakes  made by members of your gang and those made by other comrades.  Watch for blunders by the police. In street fighting, every soldier  should think like a general. Workshops should be organized right  after an action to discuss the strength and weaknesses of  techniques and strategies used. Avoid political bullshit at such  raps. Regard them as military sessions. Persons not versed in the  tactics of revolution usually have nothing worthwhile to say about  the politics of revolution.

People's Chemistry

STINK BOMB

You can purchase buteric acid at any chemical supply store for  "laboratory experiments." It can be thrown or poured directly in an  area you think already stinks. A small bottle can be left uncapped  behind a door that opens into the target room.	When a person  enters they will knock over the bottle, spilling the liquid. Called  a "Froines," by those in the know, an ounce of buteric acid can go  a long way. Be careful not to get it on your clothing. A home-made  stink bomb can be made by mixing a batch of egg whites, Drano,  (sodium hydroxide) and water. Let the mixture sit for a few days in  a capped bottle before using.

SMOKE BOMB

Sometimes it becomes strategically correct to confuse the  opposition and provide a smoke screen to aid an escape. A real  home-made stroke bomb can be made by combining four parts sugar to  six parts saltpeter (available at all chemical supply stores). This  mixture must then be heated over a very low flame. It will blend  into a plastic substance. When this starts to gel, remove from the  heat and allow the plastic to cool. Embed a few wooden match heads  into the mass while it's still pliable and attach a fuse.*

The smoke bomb itself is a non-explosive and  non-flame-producing, so no extreme safety requirements are needed.  About a pound of the plastic will produce thick enough smoke to  fill a city block. Just make sure you know which way the wind is  blowing. Weathermen-women! If you're not the domestic type, you can  order smoke flares (yellow or black) for $2.00 a flare [12 inch]  from Time Square Stage Lighting Co., 318 West 47th Street,  New York, NY 10036.

*You can make a good homemade fuse by dipping a string in glue and  then rolling it lightly in gunpowder. When the glue hardens, wrap  the string tightly and neatly with scotch tape. This fuse can be  used in a variety of ways. Weight it on one end and drop a rock  into the tank of a pig vehicle. Light the other end and run like  hell.

CBW

LACE (Lysergic Acid Crypto-Ethelene) can be made by mixing LSD  with DMSO, a high penetrating agent, and water. Sprayed from an  atomizer or squirted from a water pistol, the purple liquid will  send any pig twirling into the Never-Never Land of chromosome  damage. It produces an involuntary pelvic action in cops that  resembles fucking. Remember when Mace runs out, turn to Lace.

How about coating thin darts in LSD and shooting them from a  Daisy Air Pellet Gun? Guns and darts are available at hobby and  sports shops. Sharpening the otherwise dull darts will help in  turning on your prey.

MOLOTOV COCKTAIL

Molotov cocktails are a classic street fighting weapon served  up around the world. If you've never made one, you should try it  the next time you are in some out-of-the-way barren place just to  wipe the fear out of your mind and know that it works. Fill a  thin-walled bottle half full with gasoline. Break up a section of  styrofoam (cups made of this substance work fine) and let it sit in  the gasoline for a few days. The mixture should be slushy and  almost fill the bottle. The styrofoam spreads the flames around and  regulates the burning. The mixture has nearly the same properties  as napalm. Soap flakes (not detergents) can be substituted for  styrofoam. Rubber cement and sterno also work. In a pinch, plain  gasoline will do nicely, but it burns very fast. A  gasoline-kerosene mixture is preferred by some folks.

Throwing, although by far not the safest method, is sometimes  necessary. The classic technique of stuffing a rag in the neck of a  bottle, lighting and tossing is foolish. Often gas fumes escape  from the bottle and the mixture ignites too soon, endangering the  thrower. If you're into throwing, the following is a much safer  method: Once the mixture is prepared and inside the bottle, cap it  tightly using the original cap or a suitable cork. Then wash the  bottle off with rubbing alcohol and wipe it clean. Just before you  leave to strike a target, take a strip of rag or a tampax and dip  it in gasoline. Wrap this fuse in a small plastic baggie and attach  the whole thing to the neck of the capped bottle with the aid of  several rubber bands. When you are ready to toss, use a lighter to  ignite the baggie. Pall back your arm and fling it as soon as the  tampax catches fire. This is a very safe method if followed to the  letter. The bottle must break to ignite. Be sure to throw it with  some force against a hard surface.

Naturally, an even safer method is to place the firebomb in a  stationary position and rig up a timing fuse. Cap tightly and wipe  with alcohol as before. The alcohol wipe not only is a safety  factor, but it eliminates tell-tale fingerprints in case the  Molotov doesn't ignite. Next, attach an ashcan fire cracker (M-80)  or a cherry bomb to the side of the bottle using epoxy glue. A  fancier way is to punch a hole in the cap and pull the fuse of the  cherry bomb up through the hole before you seal the bottle. A dab  of epoxy will hold the fuse in place and insure the seal. A  firecracker fuse ignites quickly so something will have to be  rigged that will deal the action enough to make a clean getaway.

When the firebomb is placed where you want it, light up a  non-filter cancerette. Take a few puffs (being sure not to inhale  the vile fumes) to get it going and work the unlighted end over the  fuse of the firecracker. This will provide a delay of from 5 to 15  minutes. To use this type of fuse successfully, there must be  enough air in the vicinity so the flame won't go out. A strong wind  would not be good either. When the cancerette burns down, it sets  off the firecracker which in turn explodes and ignites the mixture.  The flames shoot out in the direction opposite to where you attach  the firecracker, thus allowing you to aim the firebomb at the most  flammable material. With the firecracker in the cap, the flames  spread downward in a halo. The cancerette fuse can also be used  with a book of matches to ignite a pool of gasoline or a trash can.  Stick the unlighted end behind the row of match heads and close the  cover. A firecracker attached to a gallon jug of red paint and set  off can turn an office into total abstract art.

Commercial fuses are available in many hobby stores. Dynamite  fuses are excellent and sold in most rural hardware stores. A good  way to make a homemade fuse is described above under the Smoke Bomb  section. By adding an extra few feet of fuse to the device and then  attaching the lit cancerette fuse, you add an extra measure of  caution. It is most important to test every type of fuse device you  plan to use a number of times before the actual hit. Some  experimentation will allow you to standardize the results. If you  really want to get the job done right and have the time, place  several molotov cocktails in a group and rig two with fuses (in  case one goes out). When one goes, they all go . . .BAROOOOOOOOOOM!

STERNO BOMB

One of the simplest bombs to make is the converted sterno can.  It will provide some bang and a widely dispersed spray of jellied  fire. Remove the lid from a standard, commercially purchased can  and punch a hold in the center big enough for the firecracker fuse.  Take a large spoonful of jelly out of the center to make room for  the firecracker. Insert the firecracker and pull the fuse up  through the hole in the lid. When in place, cement around the hole  with epoxy glue. Put some more glue around the rim of the can and  reseal the lid. Wipe the can and wash off excess with rubbing  alcohol. A cancerette fuse should be used. The can could also be  taped around a bottle with Molotov mixture and ignited.

AEROSOL BOMB

You can purchase smokeless gunpowder at most stores where guns  and ammunition are sold. It is used for reloading bullets. The back  of shotgun shells can be opened and the powder removed. Black  powder is more highly explosive but more difficult to come by. A  graduate chemist can make or get all you'll need. If you know one  that can be trusted, go over a lot of shit with him. Try turning  him on to learning how to make "plastics" which are absolutely the  grooviest explosive available. The ideal urban guerrilla weapons  are these explosive plastic compounds.

The neat homemade bomb that really packs a wallop can be made  from a regular aerosol can that is empty. Remove the nozzle and  punch in the nipple area on the top of the can. Wash the can out  with rubbing alcohol and let dry. Fill it gently and lovingly with  an explosive powder. Add a layer of cotton to the top and insert a  cherry bomb fuse. Use epoxy glue to hold the fuse in place and seal  the can. The can should be wiped clean with rubbing alcohol.  Another safety hint to remember is never store the powder and your  fuses or other ignition material together. Powder should always be  treated with a healthy amount of respect. No smoking should go on  in the assembling area and no striking of hard metals that might  produce a spark. Use your head and you'll get to keep it.

PIPE BOMBS

Perhaps the most widely used homemade concussion bombs are  those made out of pipe. Perfected by George Metesky, the renown  New York Mad Bomber, they are deadly, safe, easy to assemble, and  small enough to transport in your pocket. You want a standard steel  pipe (two inches in diameter is a good size) that is threaded on  both ends so you can cap it. The length you use depends on how big  an explosion is desired. Sizes between 3-10 inches in length have  been successfully employed. Make sure both caps screw on tightly  before you insert the powder. The basic idea to remember is that a  bomb is simply a hot fire burning very rapidly in a tightly  confined space. The rapidly expanding gases burst against the walls  of the bomb. If they are trapped in a tightly sealed iron pipe,  when they finally break out, they do so with incredible force. If  the bomb itself is placed in a somewhat enclosed area like a  ventilation shaft, doorway or alleyway, it will in turn convert  this larger area into a "bomb" and increase the over-all explosion  immensely.

When you have the right pipe and both caps selected, drill a  hole in the side of the pipe (before powder is inserted) big enough  to pull the fuse through. If you are using a firecracker fuse,  insert the firecracker, pull the fuse through and epoxy it into  place securely. If you are using long fusing either with a  detonator (difficult to come by) timing device or a simple  cancerette fuse, drill two holes and run two lines of fuse into the  pipe. When you have the fuse rigged to the pipe, you are ready to  add the powder. Cape one end snugly, making sure you haven't  trapped any grains of powder in the threads. Wipe the device with  rubbing alcohol and you're ready to blast off.

A good innovation is to grind down one half of the pipe before  you insert the powder. This makes the walls of one end thinner than  the walls of the other end. When you place the bomb, the explosion,  following the line of least resistance, will head in that  direction. You can do this with ordinary grinding tools available  in any hardware or machine shop. Be sure not to have the powder  around when you are grinding the pipe, since sparks are produced.  Woodstock Nation contains instructions for more pipe bombs and a  neat timing device (see pages 115-117).

GENERAL BOMB STRATEGY

This section is not meant to be a handbook on explosives.  Anyone who wishes to become an expert in the field can procure a  number of excellent books on the subject catalogued in the  Appendix. In bombing, as in trashing, the same general strategy in  regard to the selection of targets applies. Never use  anti-personnel shrapnel bombs. Always be careful in placing the  devices to keep them away from glass windows and as far away from  the front of the building as possible. Direct them away from any  area in which there might be people. Sophisticated electric timers  should be used only by experts in demolitions. Operate in the wee  hours of the night and be careful that you don't injure a night  watchman or guard. Telephone in warnings before the bomb goes off.  The police record all calls to emergency numbers and occasionally  people have been traced down by the use of a voice-o-graph. The  best way to avoid detection is by placing a huge wad of chewed up  gum on the roof of your mouth before you talk. Using a cloth over  the phone is not good enough to avoid detection. Be as brief as  possible and always use a pay phone.

When you get books from companies or libraries dealing with  explosives or guerrilla warfare, use a phony name and address.  Always do this if you obtain chemicals from a chemical supply  house. These places are being increasingly watched by the F.B.I.  Store your material and literature in a safe cool place and above  all, keep your big mouth shut!

First Aid For Street Fighters

Without intending to spook you, we think it is becoming  increasingly important for as many people as possible to develop  basic first aid skills. As revolutionary struggle intensifies, so  will the number and severity of injuries increase. Reliance on  establishment medical facilities will become risky. Hospitals that  border on "riot" areas are used by police to apprehend suspects.  All violence-induced injuries treated by establishment doctors  might be reported. Knife and gunshot wounds in all states by law  must be immediately phoned in for investigation. At times a victim  has no choice but to run such risks. If you can, use a phony name,  but everyone should know the location of sympathetic doctors.

Chaos resulting from the gassing, clubbing and shooting  associated with a police riot also makes personal first aid  important. Most demonstrations have medical teams that run with the  people and staff mobile units, but often these become the target of  assault by the more vicious pigs. Also, in the confusion, there is  usually too much work for the medical teams. Everyone must take  responsibility for everyone else if we are to survive in the  streets. If you spot someone lying unconscious or badly injured,  take it upon yourself to help the victim. Immediately raise your  arm or wave your Nation flag and shout for a medic. If the person  is badly hurt, it is best not to move him, or her, but if there is  the risk of more harm or the area is badly gassed, the victim  should be moved to safety. Try to be as gentle as possible. Get  some people to help you.

WHAT TO DO

Your attitude in dealing with an injured person is extremely  important. Don't panic at the sight of blood. Most bloody injuries  look far worse than they are. Don't get nervous if the victim is  unconscious. If you're not able to control your own fear about  treating someone, call for another person. It helps to attend a few  first aid classes to overcome these fears in practice sessions.

When you approach the victim, identify yourself. Calmly, but  quickly figure out what's the matter. Check to see if the person is  alive by feeling for the pulse. There are a number of spots to  check if the blood is circulating, under the chin near the neck,  the wrists, and ankles are the most common. Get in the habit of  feeling a normal pulse. A high pulse (over 100 per minute) usually  indicates shock. A low pulse indicates some kind of injury to the  heart or nervous system. Massaging the heart can often restore the  heartbeat, especially if its loss is due to a severe blow to the  chest. Mouth-to-mouth resuscitation should be used if the victim is  not breathing. Both these skills can be mastered in a first aid  course in less than an hour and should become second nature to  every street fighter.

When it comes to dealing with bleeding or possible fractures,  enlisting the victim's help as well as adopting a firm but calm  manner will be very reassuring. This is important to avoid shock.  Shock occurs when there is a serious loss of blood and not enough  is being supplied to the brain. The symptoms are high pulse rate;  cold, clammy, pale skin; trembling or unconsciousness. Try to keep  the patient warm with blankets or coats. If a tremendous amount of  blood has been lost, the victim may need a transfusion. Routine  bleeding can be stopped by firm direct pressure over the source of  bleeding for 5 to 10 minutes. If an artery has been cut and  bleeding is severe, a tourniquet will be needed. Use a belt, scarf  or torn shirtsleeve. Tie the tourniquet around the arm or leg  directly above the bleeding area and tighten it until the bleeding  stops. Do not loosen the tourniquet. Wrap the injured limb in a  cold wet towel or ice if available and move the person to a doctor  or hospital before irreparable damage can occur. Don't panic,  though, you have about six hours.

A painful blow to a limb is best treated with an ice pack and  elevation of the extremity by resting it on a pillow or rolled-up  jacket. A severe blow to the chest or side can result in a rib  fracture which produces sharp pains when breathing and/or coughing  up blood. Chest X-rays will eventually be needed. Other internal  injuries can occur from sharp body blows such as kidney injuries.  They are usually accompanied by nausea, vomiting, shock and  persistent abdominal pain. If you feel a bad internal injury has  occurred, get prompt professional help.

Head injuries have to be attended to with more attention than  other parts of the body. Treat them by stopping the bleeding with  direct pressure. They should be treated before other injuries as  they more quickly can cause shock. Every head injury should be  X-rayed and the injured person should be watched for the next 24  hours as complications can develop hours after the injury was  sustained. After a severe blow to the head, be on the look-out for  excessive sleepiness or difficulty in waking. Sharp and persistent  headaches, vomiting and nausea, dizziness or difficulty maintaining  balance are all warning signs. If they occur after a head injury,  call a doctor.

If a limb appears to be broken or fractured, improvise a  splint before moving the victim. Place a stiff backing behind the  limb such as a board or rolled-up magazine and wrap both with a  bandage. Try to avoid moving the injured limb as this can lead to  complicating the fracture. Every fracture must be X-rayed to  evaluate the extent of the injury and subsequent treatment.

Bullet wounds to the abdomen, chest or head, if loss of  consciousness occurs are extremely dangerous and must be seen by a  doctor immediately. If the wound occurs in the limb, treat as you  would any bleeding with direct pressure bandage and tourniquet only  if nothing else will stop the bleeding.

If you expect trouble, every person going to a street scene  should have a few minimum supplies in addition to those mentioned  in the section on Demonstrations for protection. A handful of  bandaids, gauze pads (4x4), an ace bandage (3 inch width), and a  roll of 1/2 inch adhesive tape can all easily fit in your pocket. A  plastic bag with cotton balls pre-soaked in water will come in  handy in a variety of situations where gas is being used, as will a  small bottle of mineral oil. You should write the name, phone  number and address of the nearest movement doctor on your arm with  a ballpoint pen. Your arm's getting pretty crowded, isn't it? If  someone is severely injured, it may be better to save their life by  taking them to a hospital, even though that means probable capture  for them, rather than try to treat it yourself. However, do not  confuse the police with the hospital. Many injured people have been  finished off by the porkers, and that's no joke. It is usually  better to treat a person yourself rather than let the pigs get  them, unless they have ambulance equipment right there and don't  seem vicious. Even then, they will often wait until they get two or  three victims before making a trip to the hospital.

If you have a special medical problem, such as being a  diabetic or having a penicillin allergy, you should wear a  medi-alert tag around your neck indicating your condition. Every  person who sees a lot of street action should have a tetanus shot  at least once in every five years.

Know just this much, and it will help to keep down serious  injuries at demonstrations. A few lessons in a first aid class at  one of the Free Universities or People's Clinics will go a long way  in providing you with the confidence and skill needed in the  street.

Hip-Pocket Law

LEGAL ADVICE

Any discussion about what to do while waiting fur the lawyer  has to be qualified by pointing out that from the moment of arrest  through the court appearances, cops tend to disregard a defendant's  rights. Nonetheless, you should play it according to the book  whenever possible as you might get your case bounced out on a  technicality. When you get busted, rule number one is that you have  the right to remain silent. We advise that you give only your name  and address. There is a legal dispute about whether or not you are  obligated under the law to do even that, but most lawyers feel you  should. The address can be that of a friend if you're uptight about  the pigs knowing where you live.

When the pigs grab you, chances are they are going to insult  you, rough you up a little and maybe even try to plant some  evidence on you. Try to keep your cool. Any struggle on your part,  even lying on the street limp, can be considered resisting arrest.  Even if you beat the original charge, you can be found guilty of  resisting and receive a prison sentence. Often if the pigs beat  you, they will say that you attacked them and generally charge you  with assault.

If you are stopped in the street on suspicion (which means  you're black or have long hair), the police have the right to pat  you down to see if you are carrying a weapon. They cannot search  you unless they place you under arrest. Technically, this can only  be done in the police station where they have the right to examine  your possessions. Thus, if you are in a potential arrest situation,  you should refrain from carrying dope, sharp objects that can be  classified as a weapon, and the names and phone numbers of people  close to you, like your dealer, your local bomb factory, and your  friends underground.

Forget about talking your way out of it or escaping once  you're in the car or paddy wagon. In the police station, insist on  being allowed to call your lawyer. Getting change might be a  problem so you should always have a few dimes hidden. Since many  cases are dismissed because of this, you'll generally be allowed to  make some calls, but it might take a few hours. Call a close friend  and tell him to get all the cash that can be quickly raised and  head down to the court house. Usually the police will let you know  where you'll be taken. If they don't, just tell your friend what  precinct you're being held at, and he can call the central police  headquarters and find out what court you'll be appearing in. Ask  your friend to also call a lawyer which you also should do if you  get another phone call. Hang up and dial a lawyer or defense  committee that has been set up for demonstrations. The lawyer will  either come to the station or meet you in court depending on the  severity of the charge and the likelihood you'll be beaten in the  station. When massive demonstrations are occurring where a number  of busts are anticipated, it's best to have lawyers placed in  police stations in the immediate vicinity.

The lawyer will want to know as many details as possible of  the case so try and concentrate on remembering a number of things  since the pigs aren't going to let you take notes. If you can,  remember the name and badge number of the fink that busted you.  Sometimes they'll switch arresting officers on you. Remember the  time, location of the bust and any potential witnesses that the  lawyer might be able to contact.

If you are unable to locate a lawyer, don't panic, the court  will assign you one at the time of the arraignment. Legal Aid  lawyers are free and can usually do as good a job as a private  lawyer at an arraignment. Often they can do better, as the judge  might set a lower bail if he sees you can't afford a private  lawyer. The arraignment is probably the first place you'll find out  what the charges are against you. There will also be a court date  set and bail established. The amount of bail depends on a variety  of factors ranging from previous convictions to the judge's  hangover. It can be put up in collateral, i.e., a bank book, or  often there is a cash alternative offered which amounts to about  10% of the total bail.

Your friend should be in the court with some cash (at least a  hundred dollars is recommended). For very high bail, there are the  bail bondsmen in the area of the courthouse who will cover the bail  for a fee,generally not to exceed 5%. You will need some signatures  of solid citizens to sign the bail papers and perhaps put up some  collateral.

Once you get bailed out, you should contact a private lawyer,  preferably one that has experience with your type of case. If you  are low on bread, check out one of the community or movement legal  groups in your area. It is not advisable to keep the legal aid  lawyer beyond the arraignment if at all possible.

If you're in a car or in your home, the police do not have a  right to search the premises without a search warrant or probable  cause. Do not consent to any search without a warrant, especially  if there are witnesses around who can hear you. Without your  consent, the pigs must prove probable cause in the court. It's  unbelievable the number of defendants that not only come naked, but  pull their own pants down. Make the cops kick in the door or break  open the trunk themselves. You are under no obligation to assist  them in collecting evidence, and helping them weakens your case.

JOIN THE ARMY OF YOUR CHOICE

The first rule of our new Nation prohibits any of us from  serving in the army of a foreign power with which we do not have an  alliance. Since we exist in a state of war with the Pig Empire, we  all have a responsibility to beat the draft by any means necessary.

First check out your medical history. Review every chronic or  long-term illness you ever had. Be sure to put down all the serious  infections like mono or hep. Next, make note of your physical  complications. When you have assembled a complete list, get a copy  of Physical Deferments or one of the other draft counseling manuals  and see if you qualify. If you have a legitimate deferment,  document it with a letter from a doctor.

The next best deal is a Conscientious Objection status (C.O.)  or a psychiatric deferment (psycho). The laws have been getting  progressively broader in defining C.O. status during the past few  year s. The most recent being, "sincere moral objections to war,"  without necessarily a belief in a supreme being. There are general  guidelines sent out by the National Office of Selective Service  that say it is a matter of conscience. The decision, however, is  still pretty much in the hands of the local board. Visit a Draft  Counseling Center if you feel you have a chance for this type of  story. They'll know how your local board tends to rule. There are  still some more cases to be heard by the Supreme Court before  objection to a particular war is allowed or disallowed. It is not  grounds for deferment as of now.

Psychos are our specialty. Chromosome damage has totally wiped  out our minds when it comes to concentrating on killing innocent  people in Asia. When you get your invite to join the army, there  are lots of ways you can prepare yourself mentally. Begin by  staggering up to a cop and telling him you don't know who you are  or where you live. He'll arrange for you to be chauffeured to the  nearest mental hospital. There you repeat your performance,  dropping the clue that you have used LSD in the past, but you  aren't sure if you're on it now or not. In due time, they'll put  you up for the night. When morning comes, you bounce out of bed,  remember who you are, swear you'll never drop acid again and thank  everyone who took care of you. Within a few hours, you'll be  discharged. Don't be uptight about thinking how they'll lock you up  forever cause you really are nuts. The hospitals measure victories  by how quickly they can throw you out the door. They are all  overcrowded anyway.

In most areas, a one-night stand in a mental hospital is  enough to convince the shrink at the induction center that you're  capable of eating the flesh of a colonel. Just before you go, see a  sympathetic psychiatrist and explain your sad mental shape. He'll  get verification that you did time in a hospital and include it in  his letter, that you'll take along to the induction center.

When you get to the physical examination, a high point in any  young man's life, there are lots of things working in your favor.  Here, long hair helps; the army doesn't want to bother with  trouble-makers. Remember this even though a tough looking sergeant  runs down bullshit about "how they're gonna fix your ass" and  "anybody with a trigger finger gets passed." He's just auditioning  for the Audie Murphy movies, so don't believe anything he lays  down.

Talk to the other guys about how rotten the war in Vietnam is  and how if you get forced to go, you'll end up shooting some  officers. Tell them you'd like the training so you can come back  and take up with the Weathermen.

Check off as many items as can't be verified when given the  forms. Suicide, dizzy spells, bed-wetting, dope addiction,  homosexuality, hepatitis. Be able to drop a few symptoms on the  psychiatrist to back up your story of rejection by a cold and  brutal society that was indifferent, from a domineering father that  beat you, and mother that didn't understand anything. Be able to  trace your history of bad family relationships, your taking to the  streets at 15 and eventually your getting "hooked."  Let him "pry"  things out of you if possible. Show him your letter if you had the  foresight to get one.

Practice a good story before you go for the physical with  someone who has already beat the system. If your local board is  fucked up, you can transfer to an area that disqualifies almost  everyone who wants out, such as the New York City boards. If you  can't think of anything you can always get FUCK ARMY tattooed on  the outside of the baby finger of your right hand and give the  tough sergeant a snappy salute and a hearty "yes sir!"*

*If unfortunately you get hauled in. The Army gives you a life  insurance policy. By making Dan Berrigan or Angela Davis the  beneficiary you might avoid front-line duty.

CANADA, SWEDEN & POLITICAL ASYLUM

If you've totally fucked up your chances of getting a  deferment or already are in the service and considering ditching,  there are some things that you should know about asylum.

There are three categories of countries that you should be  interested in if you are planning to ship out to avoid the draft or  a serious prison term. The safest countries are those with which  Amerika has mutual offense treaties such as Cuba, North Korea and  those behind the so-called Iron Curtain. The next safest are  countries unfriendly to the U.S. but suffer the possibility of a  military coup which might radically affect your status. Cambodia is  a recent example of a border-line country. Some cats hijacked a  ship bound for Vietnam and went to Cambodia where they were granted  asylum. Shortly thereafter the military with a good deal of help  from the CIA, took over and now the cats are in jail. Algeria is  currently a popular sanctuary in this category.

Sweden will provide political asylum for draft dodgers and  deserters. It helps to have a passport, but even that isn't  necessary since they are required by their own laws to let you in.  There are now about 35,000 exiles from the Pig Empire living in  Sweden. The American Deserters Committee, Upplandsgaten 18,  Stockholm, phone 08-344663, will provide you with immediate help,  contacts and procedural information once you get there. If you  enter as a tourist with a passport, you can just go to the local  police station, state you are seeking asylum and fill out a form.  It's that sample. They stamp your passport and this allows you to  hustle rent and food from the Swedish Social Bureau. It takes six  months for you to get working papers that will permit you to get  employment, but you can live on welfare until then with no hassle.  The following places can be contacted, for additional help. They  are all in Stockholm:

¥ Reverend Tom Hayes 82-42-11 or 21-45-86 ¥ Kristina Nystrom of the Social Bureau 08-230570 ¥ Bengt Suderstrom 31-84-32 (legal)
¥ Hans-Goran Franck 10-25-02(legal)

Canada does not offer political asylum but they do not support  the U.S. foreign policy in Southeast Asia so they allow draft  dodgers and deserters to the current tune of 50,000 to live there  unmolested. Do not tell the officials at the border that you are a  deserter or draft dodger, as they will turn you in. Pose as a  visitor. To work in Canada you have to qualify for landed  immigration status under a point system.

There will be a number of background questions asked and you  have to score 50 points or better to pass and qualify. You get one  point for each year of formal education, 10 points if you have a  professional skill, 10 points for being between 18-35 years of age,  more points for having a Canadian home and job waiting for you, for  knowing English or French and a whopping 15 points for having a  stereotyped middle class appearance and life-style. Letters from a  priest or rabbi will help here. Some entry points are easier than  others. Kingsgate, for example, just north of Montana is very good  on weekdays after 10:00 P.M.

The best approach if you are considering going to Canada is to  write or, better still, visit the Montreal Council to Aid War  Resisters, Case Postale 5, Westmount, Montreal, 215 Quebec or  American Deserters Committee, 3837 Blvd., Saint Laurent, St. Louis,  Montreal 3, Quebec. They will provide you with the latest info on  procedures and the problems of living in Canada as a war resister.  If you can't make it up there, see a local anti-war organization  for counseling. If you are already in the army, you should find out  all you need to know before you ditch. It's best to cross the  border while you're on leave as it might mean the difference  between going AWOL and desertion if you decide to come back. In any  event, no one should renounce their citizenship until they have  qualified for landed immigration status as that would classify the  person as a non-resident and make it possible for the Canadian  police to send you back, which on a few rare occasions has  happened.

Because there have been few cases of fugitives from the U.S.  seeking political asylum, there is not a clear and ample formula  that can be stated. Germany, France, Belgium and Sweden will often  offer asylum for obvious political cases but each case must be  considered individually. Go there incognito. Contact a movement  organization or lawyer and have them make application to the  government. Usually they will let you stay if you promise not to  engage in political organizing in their country. In any event if  they deport you these countries are good enough to let you pick the  country to which you desire to be sent.

We feel it's our obligation to let people know that life in  exile is not all a neat deal, not by a long shot. You are removed  from the struggle here at home, the problems of finding work are  immense and the customs of the people are strange to you. Most  people are unhappy in exile. Many return, some turn themselves in  and others come back to join the growing radical underground making  war in the belly of the great white whale.

Steal Now, Pay Never

SHOPLIFTING

This section presents some general guidelines on thievery to  put you ahead of the impulse swiping. With some planning ahead,  practice and a little nerve, you can pick up on some terrific  bargains.

Being a successful shoplifter requires the development of an  outlaw mentality. When you enter a store you should already have  cased the joint so don't browse around examining all sorts of  items, staring over your shoulder and generally appearing like  you're about to snatch something and are afraid of getting caught.  Enter, having a good idea of what you want and where it's located.

Camouflage is important. Be sure you dress the part by looking  like an average customer. If you are going to rip-off expensive  stores (why settle for less), act like you have a chauffeur driven  car double parked around the corner. A good rule is dress in the  style and price range of the clothes, etc., you are about to  shoplift. The reason we recommend the more expensive stores is that  they tend to have less security guards, relying instead on  mechanical methods or more usually on just the sales people. Many  salespeople are uptight about carrying out a bust if they catch  you. A large number are thieves themselves, in fact one good way to  steal is simply explain to the salesclerk that you're broke and ask  if you can take something without paying. It's a great way to  radicalize shop personnel by rapping to them about why they  shouldn't give a shit if the boss gets ripped off.

The best time to work out is on a rainy, cold day during a  busy shopping season. Christmas holiday is a shoplifter's paradise.  In these periods you can wear heavy overcoats or loose raincoats  without attracting suspicion. The crowds of shoppers will keep the  nosy "can-I-help-you's" from fucking up your style.

Since you have already checked out the store before hitting  it, you'll know the store's "blind-spots" where you can be busy  without being observed too easily. Dressing rooms, blind alley  aisles and washrooms are some good spots. Know where the cashier's  counter is located, where the exits to the street and storage rooms  are to be found, and most important, the type of security system in  use.

If you are going to snatch in the dressing room, be sure to  carry more than one item in with you. Don't leave tell-tale empty  hangers behind. Take them out and ditch them in the aisles.

An increasingly popular method of security is a small  shoplifting plastic detector attached to the price tag. It says "Do  Not Remove" and if you do, it electronically triggers an alarm in  the store. If you try to make it out the door, it also trips the  alarm system. When a customer buys the item, the cashier removes  the detector with a special deactivation machine. When you enter  the store, notice if the door is rigged with electronic eyes. They  are often at the waist level, which means if the item is strapped  to your calf or tucked under your hat, you can walk out without a  peep from the alarm. If you trigger the alarm either inside the  store or at the threshold, just dash off lickety-split. The  electronic eyes are often disguised as part of the decor. By  checking to see what the cashier does with merchandise bought, you  can be sure if the store is rigged. Other methods are undercover  pigs that look like shoppers, one-way mirrors and remote control  television cameras. Undercover pigs are expensive so stores are  usually understaffed. Just watch out (without appearing to watch  out) that no one observes you in action. As to mirrors and cameras  there are always blind spots in a store created when displays are  moved around, counters shifted, and boxes piled in the aisles.  Mirrors and cameras are rarely adjusted to fit these changes.  Don't get turned off by this security jazz. The percentage of  stores that have sophisticated security systems such as those  described is very small. If you work out at lunch time, the  security guards and many of the sales personnel will be out of the  store. Just before closing is also good, because the clerks are  concentrating on going home.

By taking only one or two items, you can prevent a bust if  caught by just acting like a dizzy klepto socialite getting kicks  or use the "Oh-gee-I-forgot-to-pay" routine. Stores don't want to  hassle going into court to press charges, so they usually let you  go after you return the stuff. If you thought ahead, you'll have  some cash ready to pay for the items you've pocketed, if caught.  Leave your I.D. and phone book at home before going shopping.  People rarely go to jail for shoplifting, most if caught never even  see a real cop. Just lie like a fucker and the most you'll get is a  lecture on law and order and a warning not to come back to that  store or else.

TECHNIQUES

The lining of a bulky overcoat or loose raincoat can be  elaborately outfitted with a variety of custom-made large pockets.  The openings to these pockets are not visible since they are inside  the coat. The outside pockets can be torn out leaving only the  opening or slit. Thus you can reach your hand (at counter level)  through the slit in your coat and drop objects into the secret  pockets sewn into the lining. Pants can also be rigged with secret  pockets. The idea is to let your fingers do the walking through the  slit in your coat, while the rest of the body remains the casual  browser. You'll be amazed at how much you can tuck away without any  noticeable bulge.

Another method is to use a hidden belt attached to the inside  of your coat or pants. The belt is specially designed with hooks or  clothespins to which items can be discretely attached. Ditching  items into hidden pockets requires a little cunning. You should  practice before a mirror until you get good at it.

A good idea is to work with a partner. Dig this neat duet. A  man and woman walk into a store together looking like a respectable  husband and wife. The man purchases a good belt or shirt and  engages the salesman in some distracting conversation as he rings  up the sale. Meanwhile, back in the aisle, "wife" is busy rolling  up two or three suits. Start from the bottom while they are still  on the rack and roll them up, pants and jackets together, the way  you would roll a sleeping bag. The sleeves are tied around the roll  making a neat little bundle. The bundle is then tucked between your  thighs. The whole operation takes about a minute and with some  practice you can walk for hours with a good size bundle between  your legs and not appear like you just shit in your pants. Try this  with a coat on in front of a mirror and see how good you get at it.

Another team method is for one or more partners to distract  the sales clerks while the other stuffs. There are all sorts of  theater skits possible. One person can act drunk or better still  appear to be having an epileptic fit. Two people can start a fight  with each other. There are loads of ways, just remember how they do  it in the next spy movie you see.

One of the best gimmicks around is the packaging technique.  Once you have the target item in hand, head for the fitting room or  other secluded spot. Take out a large piece of gift wrapping and  ribbon. Quickly wrap up the item so it will look like you brought  it in with you. Many stores have their own bags and staple the cash  register receipt to the top of the bag when you make a purchase.  Get a number of these bags by saving them if you make a purchase or  dropping around to the receiving department with a request for some  bags for your Christmas play or something. Next collect some sales  receipts, usually from the sidewalk or trash cans in front of the  store. Buy or rip-off a small pocket stapler for less than a  dollar. When you get the item you want, drop it in the bag and  staple it closed, remembering to attach the receipt. This is an  absolutely perfect method and takes just a few seconds. It  eliminates a lot of unsightly bulges in your coat and is good for  warm-weather heisting.

A dummy shopping bag can be rigged with a bit of ingenuity.  The idea is to make it look like the bag is full when there's still  lots of room left. Use strips of cardboard taped to the inside of  the bag to give it some body. Remember to carry it like it's filled  with items, not air. Professional heisters often use a "booster  box," usually a neatly wrapped empty package with one end that  opens upon touch. This is ideal for electrical appliances, jewelry,  and even heavy items such as portable television sets. The trick  side can be fitted with a spring door so once the toaster is inside  the door slams shut. Don't wear a black hat and cape and go around  waving a wand yelling "Abracadabra," just be your usual shlep  shopper self. If you can manage it, the trick side just can be an  opening without a trick door. Just carry the booster box with the  open side pressed against your body. Briefcases, suitcases and  other types of carrying devices can all be made to hold items. Once  you have something neatly tucked away in a bag or box, it's pretty  hard to prove you didn't come in with it.

ON THE JOB

By far the easiest and most productive method of stealing is  on the job. Wages paid to delivery boys, sales clerks, shippers,  cashiers and the like are so insulting that stealing really is a  way of maintaining self-respect. If you are set on stealing the  store dry when you apply for the job, begin with your best foot  forward. Make what employment agencies call a "good appearance."  Exude cleanliness, Godliness, sobriety and all the other WASPy  virtues third grade teachers insist upon. Building up a good front  will eliminate suspicion when things are "missing."

Mail clerks and delivery boys can work all sorts of neat  tricks. When things get a little slow, type up some labels  addressed to yourself or to close friends and play Santa Claus.  Wrap yourself a few packages or take one that is supposed to go to  a customer and put your label over theirs. Blame it on the post  office or on the fact that "things get messed up `cause of all the  bureaucracy." It's great to be the one to verbalize the boss's own  general feelings before he does when something goes awry. The best  on-the-job crooks always end up getting promoted.

Cashiers and sales persons who have access to money can pick  up a little pocket change without too much effort, no matter how  closely they are watched by supervisors. Women can make use of torn  hems to stash coins and bills. Men can utilize cuffs. Both can use  shoes and don't forget those secret little pockets you learned  about in the last section. If you ring up items on a cash register,  you can easily mistake $1.39 for 39¢ or $1.98 for 98¢ during the  course of a hectic day. Leave pennies on the top shelf of the cash  register and move one to the far right side every time you skip a  dollar. That way at the end of the day, you'll know how much to  pocket and won't have to constantly be stuffing, stuffing,  stuffing.

If you pick up trash or clean up, you can stick all sorts of  items into wastebaskets and later sneak them out of the store.

There are many ways of working heists with partners who pose  as customers. See the sections on free food and clothing for these.  There are also ways of working partnerships on the job. A cashier  at a movie theater and a doorman can work out a system where the  doorman collects the tickets and returns them to the cashier to  sell again.

A neat way to make a large haul is to get a job through an  agency as a domestic for some rich slob. You should use a phony  identification when you sign up at the agency. Once you are busy  dusting the town house, check around for anything valuable to be  taken home. Pick up the phone, order all sorts of merchandise, and  have it delivered. A friend with a U-haul can help you really clean  up.

CREDIT CARDS

Any discussion of shoplifting and forgeries inevitably leads  to a rap on credit cards; those little shiny plastic wonder passes  to fantasy land that are rendering cash obsolete. There are many  ways to land a free credit card. You can get one yourself if your  credit is good, or from a friend: report it stolen and go on a  binge around town. Sign your name a little funny. Super underworld  types might know where you can purchase a card that's not too hot  on the black market. You might heist one at a fashionable party or  restaurant. If you're a hat check girl at a night club, don't  forget to check out pockets and handbags for plastic goodies.*

Finally, you can redo a legitimate card with a new number and  signature and be sure that it's on no one's "hot list." Begin by  removing the ink on the raised letters with any polyester resin  cleaner. Next, the plastic card should be held against a flat iron  until the raised identification number is melted. You can use a  razor blade to shave off rough spots. This combination of razor  blade and hot iron, when worked skillfully, will produce a perfect  blank card. When the card is smooth as new, reheat it using the  flat iron and press an addressograph plate into the soft plastic.  The ink can be replaced by matching the original at any stationary  store. If this is too hard, you can buy machines to make your own  credit cards, which are made for small department stores. Granted,  this method is going require some expertise, but once you've  learned to successfully forge a credit card, buy every item  imaginable, eat fancy meals, and even get real money from a bank.

*The absolute best method is to have an accomplice working in the  post office rip off the new cards that are mailed out. They get to  know quickly which envelopes contain new credit cards. Since the  person never receives the card it never dawns on them to report it  stolen. This gives you at least a solid month of carefree spending  and your signature will be perfect.

Whether your credit card is stolen, borrowed or forged, you  still have to follow some guidelines to get away without any  hassle. Know the store's checking method before you pass the hot  card. Most stores have a fifty-dollar limit where they only call  upstairs on items costing fifty dollars or more. In some stores  it's less. Some places have a Regiscope system that takes your  picture with each purchase. You should always carry at least one  piece of back-up identification to use with the phony card as the  clerk might get suspicious if you don't have any other ID. They can  check out a "hot list" that the credit card companies send out  monthly, so if you're uptight about anything watch the clerk's  movements at all times. If things get tight, just split real quick.  Often, even if a clerk or boss thinks it's a phony, they'll OK the  sale anyway since the credit card companies make good to the stores  on all purchases; legit or otherwise. Similarly, the insurance  companies make good to the credit companies and so on until you get  to a little group of hard working elves in the basement of the U.S.  Mint who do nothing but print free money and lie to everybody about  there being tons of gold at Fort Knox to back up their own little  forging operation.

Monkey Warfare

If you like Halloween, you'll love monkey warfare. It's ideal  for people uptight about guns, bombs and other children's toys, and  allows for imaginative forms of protesting, many of which will  become myth, hence duplicated and enlarged upon. A syringe (minus  the needle) or a cooking baster can be filled with a dilute  solution of epoxy glue. Get the two tubes in a hardware store and  squeeze into a small bottle of rubbing alcohol. Shake real good and  pour into the baster or syringe. You have about thirty minutes  before the mixture gets too hard to use. Go after locks, parking  meters, and telephones. You can fuck up the companies that use IBM  cards by buying a cheap punch or using an Exacto knife and cutting  an extra hole in the card before you return it with your payment.  By the way, when you return payments always pay a few cents under  or over. The company has to send you a credit or another bill and  it screws up their bookkeeping system. Remember, always bend, fold,  staple or otherwise mutilate the card. By the way if you ever find  yourself in a computer room during a strike, you might want to fuck  up the school records. You can do this by passing a large magnet or  portable electro-magnet rapidly back and forth across the reels of  tape, thus erasing them. And don't miss the tour of the IBM plant,  either.

Another good bit is to rent a safe deposit box (only about  $7.00 a year) in a bank using a phony name. That usually only need  a signature and don't ask for identification. When you get a box,  deposit a good size dead fish inside the deposit box, close it up  and return it to its proper niche. From then on, forget about it.  Now think about it, in a few months there is going to be a  hell-of-a-smell from your small investment. It's going to be almost  impossible to trace and besides, they can never open the box  without your permission. Since you don't exist, they'll have no  alternative but to move away. Invest in the Stank of Amerika  savings program. Just check out Lake Erie and you'll see saving  fish isn't such a dumb idea. If you get caught, tell them you  inherited the fish from your grandmother and it has sentimental  value.

There are lots of things you can send banks, draft boards and  corporations that contribute to pollution via the mails. It is  possible to also have things delivered. Have a hearse and flowers  sent to the chief of police. We know someone who had a truckload of  cement dumped in the driveway of her boss under the fib that the  driveway was going to be repaved.

By getting masses of people to use electricity, phones or  water at a given time, you can fuck up some not-so-public utility.  The whole problem is getting the word out. For example, 10,000  people turning on all their electrical appliances and lights in  their homes at a given time can cause a blackout in any major city.  A hot summer day at about 3:00 PM is best. Five thousand people  calling up Washington, D.C. at 3:00 PM on a Friday (one of the  busiest hours) ties up the major trunk lines and really puts a  cramp in the government's style of carrying on. Call (202)  555-1212, which is information and you won't even have to pay for  the call. If you call a government official, ask some questions  like "How many kids did you kill today?" or "What kind of liquor do  Congressmen drink?" or offer to take Teddy Kennedy for a ride. A  woman can cause some real excitement by calling a Congressman's  office and screaming "Tell that bastard he forgot to meet Irene at  the motel this afternoon."

A Washington call-in would work even better by phoning direct  to homes of the big boys. For starters you can call collect the  following*:

¥ Richard M. Nixon - El Presidente - (202) 456-1444 ¥ Spiro T. Agnew - El Toro - (202) 265-2000 ext. 6400 ¥ John N. Mitchell - El Butcher - (202) 965-2900 ¥ Melvin R. Laird - El Defendo - (301) 652-4449 ¥ Henry A. Kissinger - El Exigente - (202) 337-0042 ¥ William P. Rogers - El Crapper - (301) 654-7125 ¥ General Earl G. Wheeler - El Joint Bosso - (703) 527-6119 ¥ General William C. Westmoreland - El Pollutoni - (703) 527-6999 ¥ Richard M. Helms - El Assassin - (301) 652-4122 ¥ John N. Chafee-El Sinko Swimmi-(703) 536-5411

A great national campaign can be promoted that asks people to  protest the presidential election farces on Inauguration Day. When  a president says "So help me God," rush in and flush the toilet. A  successful Flush for God campaign can really screw up the water  system.

If you want to give Ma Bell an electric permanent, consider  this nasty. Cut the female device off an ordinary extension cord  and expose the two wires. Unscrew the mouthpiece on the phone and  remove the voice amplifier. You will see a red and a black wire   attached to two terminals. Attach each of the wires from the  extension cord to each one from the phone. Next plug in the  extension cord to a wall socket. What you are doing is sending 120  volts of electricity back through equipment which is built for only  volts. You can knock off thousands of phones, switchboards and  devices if all goes right. It's best to do this on the phone in a  large office building or university. You certainly will knock out  their fuses. Unfortunately, at home your own phone will probably be  knocked out of commission. If that happens, simply call up the  business office and complain. They'll give you a new phone just the  way they give the other seven million people that requested them  that day.

Remember, January is Alien Registration Month, so don't forget  to fill out an application at the Post Office, listing yourself as  a citizen of Free Nation. Then when they ask you to "Love it or  leave it," tell them you already left!

Piece Now

It's ridiculous to talk about a revolution without a few words  on guns. If you haven't been in the army or done some hunting, you  probably have a built-in fear against guns that can only be  overcome by familiarizing yourself with them.

HANDGUNS

There are two basic types of handguns or pistols: the  revolver carries a load of 5 or 6 bullets in a "revolving"  chamber. The automatic usually holds the same number, but some  can hold up to 14 bullets. Also, in the automatic the bullets  can be already packed in a magazine which quickly snaps into  position in the handle. The revolver must be reloaded one  bullet at a time. An automatic can jam on rare occasions, or  misfire, but with a revolver you just pull the trigger and  there's a new bullet ready to fire. Despite pictures of Roy  Rogers blasting a silver dollar out of the sky, handguns are  difficult to master a high degree of accuracy with and are  only good at short ranges. If you can hit a pig-size object at  25 yards, you've been practicing.

Among automatics, the Colt 45 is a popular model with a long  record of reliability. A good popular favorite is a Parabellum 9  mm, which has the advantage of a double action on the first shot,  meaning that the hammer does not have to be cocked, making possible  a quick first shot without carrying a cocked gun around. By the  way, do not bother with any handgun smaller than a .38 caliber,  because cartridges smaller than that are too weak to be effective.

Revolvers come in all sizes and makes, as do automatics. The  most highly recommended are the .38 Special and the .357 Magnum.  Almost all police forces use the .38 Special. They are light,  accurate and the small-frame models are easy to conceal. If you get  one, use high velocity hollow pointed bullets, such as the Speer  DWM (146 grain h.p.) or the Super Vel (110 grain h.p.). The hollow  point shatters on contact, insuring a kill to the not-so-straight  shooters. Smith and Wesson makes the most popular .38 Special. The  Charter Arms is a favorite model. The .357 Magnum is an extremely  powerful handgun. You can shoot right through the wall of a thick  door with one at a distance of 20 yards. It has its own ammo, but  can also use the bullets designed for the .38. Both guns are about  the same in price, running from $75-$100 new. An automatic  generally runs about $25 higher.

RIFLES

There are two commonly available types of rifles; the bolt  action and the semi-automatic. War surplus bolt action rifles are  cheap and usually pretty accurate, but have a slower rate of fire  than a semi-automatic. A semi-automatic is preferable in nearly all  cases. The M-1 carbine is probably the best semi-automatic for the  money (about $80). It's light, short, easy to handle and has only  the drawback of a cartridge that's a little underpowered. Among  bolt actions, the Springfield, Mauser, Royal Enfield, Russian 7.62,  and the Lee Harvey Oswald Special, the Mannlicher-Carcano, are all  good buys for the money (about $20).

One of the best semi-automatics is the AR-18, which is the  civilian version of the military M-16. In general, this is a  fantastic gun with a high rate of fire, minimal recoil, high  accuracy, light weight, and easy maintenance. If kept clean, it  will rarely jam, and the bullet has astounding stopping power. It  sells for around $225.

SHOTGUNS

The shotgun is the ideal defensive weapon. It's perfect for  the vamping band of pigs or hard-heads that tries to lynch you.  Being a good shot isn't that necessary because a shotgun shoots a  bunch of lead pellets that spread over a wide range as they leave  the barrel. There are two common types: the pump action and the  semi-automatic. Single shot types and double-barrel types do not  have a high enough rate of fire for self-defense.

The pump action is easy to use and reliable. It usually holds  about five shells in a tube underneath the barrel. For self-defense  you should use 00 buckshot shells. Shotguns come in various gauges,  but you will want the largest commonly available, the 12 gauge. The  Mossberg Model 500 A is a super weapon in this category which sells  for about $90. When buying one, try to get a shotgun with a barrel  as short as possible up to the legal limit of 18 inches. It is easy  to cut down a longer barrel, too. This increases the area sprayed.

The semi-automatic gun is not used too much for self-defense,  as they usually hold only three shells. With some practice, you can  shoot a pump nearly as fast as a semi-automatic, and they are much  cheaper. See the gun books catalogued in the Appendix for more  information.

There are many other good guns available, and a great deal to  know about choosing the right gun for the right situation. Reading  a little right wing gun literature will help.

OTHER WEAPONS

If you are around a military base, you will find it relatively  easy to get your hands on an M-79 grenade launcher, which is like a  giant shotgun and is probably the best self-defense weapon of all  time. Just inquire discreetly among some long-haired soldiers.

TRAINING

Owning a gun ain't shit unless you know how to use it. They  make a hell of a racket when fired so you just can't work out in  your den or cellar except with a BB gun, which is good in between  real practice sessions. Find a buddy who served in the military or  is into hunting or target-shooting and ask him to teach you the  fundamentals of gun handling and safety. If you're over 18, you can  practice on one of your local firing ranges. Look them up in the  Yellow Pages, call and see if they offer instructions. They are  usually pretty cheap to use. In an hour, you can learn the basics  you need to know about guns and the rest is mostly practice,  practice, just like in the westerns. Contact the National Rifle  Association, Washington D.C. and ask for information on forming a  gun club. If you can, you are entitled to great discounts, have no  trouble using ranges and get excellent info on all matters relating  to weapons.

A secluded place in the country outside city limits, makes an  ideal range for practicing. Shoot at positioned targets. A good  idea is to blow up balloons and attach them to pieces or boxes.  Position yourself downstream alongside a running brook. A partner  can go upstream and release the balloons into the water. As they  rush downstream, they simulate an attacker charging you and make  excellent moving targets. Watch out for ricochetting bullets. Have  any bystander stand by behind you. A clothesline with a pulley  attachment can be rigged up to also allow practice with a moving  target.

GUN LAWS

Once you decide to get a gun, check out the local laws. There  are federal ones, but they're not stricter than any state  ordinance. If you're unsure about the laws, send 75¢ to the U.S.  Government Printing Office for the manual called Published  Ordinances: Firearms. It runs down the latest on all state laws. In  most states you can buy a rifle or shotgun just for the bread from  a store or individual if you are over 18 years old. You can get a  handgun when you can prove you're over 21, although you generally  need a special permit to carry it concealed on your person or in   your car. A concealed weapon permit is pretty hard to get unless  you're part of the establishment. You can keep a handgun in your  home, though. It's also generally illegal to walk around with a  loaded gun of any type. Once you get the hang of using a gun,  you'll never want to go back to the old peashooter.

The Underground

Amerika is just another Latin dictatorship. Those who have  doubts, should try the minimal experience of organizing a large  rock festival in their state*, sleeping on some beach in the summer  or wearing a flag shirt. Ask the blacks what it's been like living  under racism and you'll get a taste of the future we face. As the  repression increases so will the underground-deadly groups of  stoned revolutionaries sneaking around at night and balling all  day. As deadly as their southern comrades the Tupamaros. Political  trials will only occur when the heavy folks are caught. Too many  sisters and brothers have been locked up for long stretches having  maintained a false faith in the good will of the court system.  Instead, increased numbers have chosen to become fugitives from  injustice: Bernadine Dohrn, Rap Brown, Mark Rudd, hundreds of  others. Some including Angela Davis, Father Berrigan and Pun  Plamondon have been apprehended and locked in cages, but most roam  freely and actively inside the intestines of the system. Their  growth leads to persistent indigestion for those who sit at the  tables of power. As they form into active isolated cells they make  apprehension difficult. Soon the FBI will have a Thousand Most  Wanted List. Our heroes will be hunted like beasts in the jungle.  Anyone who provides information leading to the arrest of a fugitive  is a traitor.

*Unless you want to use our music to attack our politics as the  governor of Oregon did to drain support away from demonstrations  against the AmeriKKKan Legion. In such a situation the concert  should be sabotaged along with political education as to why such  an action has been taken. Don't let the pigs separate our culture  from our politics.

Well fellow reader, what will you do when Rap or Bernadine  call up and ask to crash for the night? What if the Armstrong  Brothers want to drop some acid at your pad or Kathy Boudin needs  some bread to keep on truckin'? The entire youth culture, everyone  who smiles secretly when President Agnew and General Mitchell refer  to the growing number of "hot-headed revolutionaries", all the  folks who hope the Cong wins, who cheer the Tupamaros on, who want  to exchange secret handshakes with the Greek resistance movement,  who say "It's about time" when the pigs get gunned down in the  black community, all of us have an obligation to support the  underground. They are the vanguard of our revolution and in a sense  this book is dedicated to their courage.

If you see a fugitive's picture on the post office wall take  it home for a souvenir. But watch out, because this is illegal.  Soon the FBI will be printing all our posters for free. Right on,  FBI! Print up wanted posters of the war criminals in Washington and  undercover agents (be absolutely sure) and put them up instead.  Since the folks underground move freely among us, we must be  totally cool if by chance we recognize a fugitive through their  disguise. If they deem it necessary to contact you, they will make  the first move. If you are very active in the aboveground movement,  chances are you are being watched or tapped and it would be  foolhardy to make contact. The underground would be meaningless  without the building of a massive community with corresponding  political goals. People above ground demonstrate their love for  fugitives by continuing and intensifying their own commitment.

If the FBI or local subversive squad of the police department  is asking a lot of questions about certain fugitives, get the word  out. Call your underground paper or make the announcement at large  movement gatherings or music festivals; the grapevine will pass  information on to those that need to know.

If you're forced to go underground, don't think you need to  link up with the more well-known groups such as the Weathermen. If  you go under with some close friends, stick together if it's  possible. Build contacts with aboveground people that are not that  well known to the authorities and can be totally trusted.

You should change the location in which you operate and move  to a place where the heat on yon won't be as heavy. A good disguise  should be worked out. The more information the authorities have on  you and the heavier the charges determine how complete your  disguise should be. There are some good tips in the books on  make-up listed in the Appendix. Only in rare cases is it necessary  to abandon the outward appearance of belonging to the youth  culture. In fact, even J. Edgar Freako admits that our culture is  our chief defense. To infiltrate the youth culture means becoming  one of us. For an FBI agent to learn an ideological cover is a  highly disciplined organization is relatively easy. To penetrate  the culture means changing the way they live. The typical agent  would stand out like Jimmy Stewart in a tribe of Apaches.

In the usual case the authorities do not look for a fugitive  in the sense of carrying on a massive manhunt. Generally, people  are caught for breaking some minor offense and during the routine  arrest procedure, their fingerprints give them away. Thus for a  fugitive having good identification papers being careful about  violations such as speeding or loitering, and not carrying weapons  or bombing manuals become an important part of the security. It is  also a good idea to have at least a hundred dollars cash on you at  all times. Often even if you are arrested you can bail yourself out  and split long before the fingerprints or other identification  checks are completed.

If by some chance you are placed on the "10 Most Wanted List"  that is a signal that the FBI are indeed conducting a manhunt. It  is also the hint that they have uncovered some clues and feel  confident they can nab you soon. The List is a public relations  gimmick that Hooper, or whatever his name is, dreamed up to show  the FBI as super sleuths, and compliment the bullshit image of them  that Hollywood lays down. Most FBI agents are southerners who  majored in accounting or some other creative field. When you are  placed on the List, go deeper underground. It may become necessary  to curtail your activities for a while. The manhunt lasts only as  long as you are newsworthy since the FBI is very media conscious.  Change your disguise, identification and narrow your circle of  contacts. In a few months, when the heat is off, you'll be able to  be more active, but for the time, sit tight.

IDENTIFICATION PAPERS

An amateur photographer or commercial artist with good  processing equipment can make passable phony identification papers.  Using a real I.D. card, mask out the name, address, and signature  with thin strips of paper the same color as the card itself. Do a  neat gluing job. Next, photograph the card using bright overhead  lighting to avoid shadows, or xerox it. Use a paper of a color and  weight as close to the real thing as you can get. If you use phony  state and city papers such as birth certificate or driver's  license, choose a state that is far away from the area in which you  are located. Have a complete understanding of all the information  you are forging. Dates, cities, birthdays and other data are often  part of a coding system. Most are easy to figure out simply by  studying a few similar authentic cards.

Almost all I.D. cards use one or another IBM Selectric type to  fill in the individual's papers. You can buy the exact model used  by federal and state agencies for less than $20.00 and install the  ball in 5 seconds on any Selectric machine. When you finish the  typing operation, sign your new name and trim the card to the size  you want. Rub some dirt on the card and bend it a little to  eliminate its newness.

Another method is to obtain a set of papers from a close  friend of similar characteristics. Your friend can replace the  originals without too much trouble. In both cases it might be  advisable to get authentic papers using the phonies you have in  your possession. In some states getting a license or voting  registration card is very easy. Library cards and other  supplementary I.D.'s are simple to get. A passport should not be  attempted until you definitely have made up your mind to split the  country. That way agencies have less time to check the information  and you can decide on the disguise to be used for the picture.  Unless you expect to get hotter than you are right now, in which  case, get it now.

It is wise to have two sets of identification to be on the  safe side but never have both in your possession at the same time.  If you sense the authorities are close to mailing you and choose to  go underground, prepare all the identification papers well in  advance and store them in a secure place. Inform no one of your  possible new identity.

Before you start passing phony I.D.'s to cops, banks and  passport offices, you should have experience with lesser targets so  you feel comfortable using them. There are stiff penalties for this  if you get caught. A few better methods than the ones listed above  exist, but we feel they should not be made this public. With a  little imagination you'll have no trouble. Dig!

COMMUNICATION

Living underground, like exile, can be extremely lonely,  especially during the initial adjustment period when you have to  reshuffle your living habits. Psychologically it becomes necessary  to maintain a few close contacts with other fugitives or folks  aboveground. This is also necessary if you plan to continue waging  revolutionary struggle. This means communication. If you contact  persons or arrange for them to contact you, be super cool. Don't  rush into meetings. Stay OFF the phone! If you must, use pay  phones. Have the contact person go to a prescribed booth at  prescribed time. Knowing the phone number beforehand, you can call  from another pay phone. The pay phone system is superior to  debugging devices and voice scramblers. Even so, some pay phones,  that local police suspect bookies use, are monitored.

Keep your calls short and disguise your voice a bit. If you  are a contact and the call does not come as scheduled, don't panic.  Perhaps the booth at the other end is occupied or the phone you are  on is out of order. In New York, the latter is usually true. Wait a  reasonable length of time and then go about your business. Another  contact will be made. Personal rendezvous should take place at  places that are not movement hangouts or heavy pig scenes.  Intermediaries should be used to see if anyone was followed. Just  groove on a few good spy flicks and you'll figure it all out.

Communicating to masses of people above ground is very  important. It drives the MAN berserk and gives hope to comrades in  the struggle. The most important message is that you are alive, in  good spirits and carrying on the struggle. The communications of  the Weathermen are brilliantly conceived. Develop a mailing list  that you keep well hidden in case of a bust. You can devise a  system of mailing stuff in envelopes (careful of fingerprints)  inside larger envelopes to a trusted contact who will mail the  items from another location to further camouflage your area of  operation. A host of communication devices are available besides  handwritten notes and typed communications. Tape recorders are  excellent but better still are video-tape cassette machines. You  can wear masks, do all kinds of weird theatrical stuff and send the  tapes to television stations. At times you might want to risk being  interviewed by a newsman, but this can be very dangerous unless you  conceive a super plan and have some degree of trust in the word of  the journalist. Don't forget a grand jury could be waiting for him  with a six months contempt or perjury charge when he admits contact  and does not answer their questions.

The only other advice is to dress warm in the winter and cool  in the summer, stay high and.

LIBERATION!

THE SUBWAY SYSTEM
The first thing to do is get familiar with the geography of  stops you use most frequently. Locate the token cage. Check to see  whether the exits are within easy view of the teller, off to the  side, or blocked from view by concrete pole-supporters. Next learn  the type of turnstile in use. Follow the hints laid down in the  Free Transportation section.

The rush hours are always the easiest times. Just go through  the exits as people push open the door. Also at crowded hours,  people go single file past the turnstiles, one after another in a  steady stream. Get in line and go under. The people will block you  from view and won't do anything. Even a cop won't give you much  hassle. Some subway stations have concrete supports that block the  teller's view. Where these exist, slip through the exit nearest the  pole or slide by the turnstile.

Turnstile jumping is such a skill, it's going to be added to  the Olympics. There are three basic styles common to New York and  most cities and each needs a slightly different approach.

The Old Wooden Cranker-(Traditional) You have to go under or  sail over this type. Going under is a smoother trip. Going over is  trickier since you need both hands free to hurdle and it's a  quicker, more noticeable motion.

New-Aluminum-Bar-Turnstiles-Which-Turn-Both-Ways-For-Exit-and- Entrance-Approach it with confidence. Pretend you're putting in a  token with your right hand and pull the bar toward you one third of  the way with your left hand. Go through the space left between the  bars and the barrier. Not for heavyweights!

New-Aluminum-Bar-Turnstiles-Which-Can-Be- Used-Only-For-Entrance-They won't pull towards you, and so, you  must go either under or over them.

NOTE: There is no way to tell a 
New-Aluminum-Bar-Turnstile-Which-Turns-Both-- Ways-For-Exit-and-Entrance from a New-Aluminum-Bar-Turnstile-Which- Can-Be-Used-Only-For-Entrance unless there is a sign. You have to  try it first. Therefore, it is important to remember which kind is  in use at your local station so your technique will be smooth. Once  you're through, remember in your mind you've paid. Ignore everybody  who tries to stop you or tell you different. If someone shouts just  keep on truckin' on toward your track. Don't stop or run. Insist  you are right if you ever get caught. We have been doing it for  years, got caught twice and let go both tunes when other passengers  insisted we paid. Everybody hates the subways, even the tellers.

FREEBIES

Clothing Repairs
All Wallach stores feature a service that includes sewing on  buttons, free shoe horns, and shoe laces, mending pants pockets and  linings, punching extra holes in belts, and a number of other free  services.

Furniture
By far the best place to get free furniture in New York is on  the street. Once a week in every district, the Sanitation  Department makes bulk pick-ups. The night before, residents put out  all kinds of stuff on the street. For the best selection try the  West Village on Monday nights, and the East Seventies on Tuesday  nights. On Wednesday night there are fantastic pick-ups on 35th St.  in-back of Macy's. Move quickly though, the guards get pissed off  easily; the truckers couldn't care less. This street method can  furnish your whole pad. Beds, desks, bureaus, lamps, bookcases,  chairs, and tables. It's all a matter of transportation. If you  don't have access to a car or truck, it's worth it to rent a  station wagon and make pick-ups.

Ghosts
If you would like to meet a real ghost, write Hans Holtzer,  c/o New York Committee for Investigation for Paranormal Research,  140 Riverside Drive, New York, NY. He'll put you in touch for free.

Free Lessons
Lessons in a variety of skills such as plumbing, electricity,  jewelry-making, construction and woodworking are provided by the  Mechanics Institute, 20 W. 44th St. Call or write them well in  advance for a schedule. You must sign up early for lessons as they  try to maintain small courses. MU 7-4279.

The Staten Island Ferry-Not free, but a nickel each way for a  five mile ocean voyage around the southern tip of Manhattan is  worth it. Take IRT (Broadway line) to South Ferry, local only.  Ferry leaves every half-hour day and night.

HOUSING

Contrary to rumors, none of us have ever been to Chicago.  None-the-less, we have some friends who have visited the area. In  Chicago, everyone 17 or under must be off the streets by 10:30 PM  and by 11:30 PM on Fridays and Saturdays. Don't sleep in Lincoln  Park during political conventions, but other nights it's O.K.  Wasn't it Hillel who asked, "Why is this night different from all  other nights?" And wasn't it Mayor Richard J. Daley who responded,  "Cause I say get your ass out of the park!"

The Chicago Seed (929-0133) will give you the best advice on  crashing and the local heat scene. Grace Lutheran Church, 555 W.  Beldon St., and the Looking Glass at 1725 W. Wilson also have  crashing places or know where you can find free room and board.

You won't get hassled if you sack out in the Union Station on  Adams Street just over the bridge. There are loads of folks  crashing in abandoned buildings along LaSalle and other streets.  Also the rooftops are cool. Stay off the streets though, unless  you've got good identification.

FOOD

SCLC (Operation Breadbasket) has a free breakfast program  every morning Monday through Friday from 7-10 AM at St. Anna  Church, 55th St. and LaSalle St., and also at Christ the King  Lutheran Church located at 3700 Lake Park.

You can get free samples of cheese, meat, and coffee everyday  at the Stop and Shop food store located on Washington between  Dearborn and State Streets. At the Treasure Island grocery store  located on Broadway, two blocks north of Belmont, free coffee and  cookies are offered for the people. Halloway House at 27 W.  Randolph gives coupons good for coffee. Also at the Guild Bookstore  at 25 W. Jackson Blvd., and from the machines at the 4th through  14th floors of the Playboy Building.

There are real cheap restaurants. One is a truck-stop in  Skokie called Karl's Cafe. It's just north of Oakton on Skokie  Highway. It's open until 6:00. You get a whole lot of food for  $1.00. Also, under the viaduct at Milwaukee and Damen is a small  restaurant with Polish food. You can get a great meal for $1.35.  It's worth a visit. It closes early in the evening. Another cheap  restaurant is Paul and Ernie's on North Lincoln, just south of  Wrightwood. You can have a beef dinner for about 70 cents.

A good place to pick up free vegetables and fruits is at the  wholesale market on Randolph St. or S. Water St. on Friday  afternoons. Many of the food factories such as Kraft Dairy Products  give away free samples and cases for "charity." Check them out.

It is possible to steal food from the 2nd floor Federal  Building Cafeteria at Adams and Dearborn and the National Cafeteria  at Clark and Van Buren. These cafeterias usually have long lines  and you can eat while standing and just pay for the coffee.

If you have a place to cook and store food, there are a few  places that have pretty cheap food. The east gate of International  Harvester, located at 1015 W. 120th St. is unbelievable. Dig these  bargains! 10 pounds of T-bone steaks (boxed) for $5.25 at midnight.  at 4 PM, the produce man brings a different combination of goods. A  typical bill of fare might include tomatoes, cucumbers,  strawberries, etc. at $1.00 for 10 pounds of any item. The produce  might vary from day to day, but the prices stay the same. On  Thursdays at noon and 4 PM, the Lennell cookie man comes around.  It's $1.25 per box. At 7 PM, the sausage man arrives and the  standard price is $2.00. The standard size is 3 to 5 pounds. He has  salami, liver sausage, polish sausage, and usually odd lunchmeat  such as bologna or summer sausage. All the food is sold out of  trucks, and the prices might not be exact, but they're pretty  close.

Eggs are about 3 dozen for $2.00 on Randolph west of Halsted.  Orange juice is pretty cheap at the Del Farm on Broadway. Wonder  Bread thrift store on Diversey; Butternut, 87th St. and Ridgeland  and 1471 W. Wilson, and Silvercup, 55th and Federal, offer bread  and rolls at big discounts. The Cicero Bottling Company at 31st St.  and 48 Court sell a case of 12 quart bottles for $2.00. Mamas  Cookies, 7400 S. Kastner give 5 pounds for $1.50. At Burhops, State  and Grand, you can get cheap 5-pound boxes of steak. The Railroad  Salvage around Madison and Halsted has dented cans (with stuff  inside) for big discounts. It is also a good place for paper  products. Campbell Soup, 2250 W. 55th St., open Tuesday and  Thursday, will give you cases free or at discounts if you tell them  it's for charity or look straight. Two good spots for all around  shopping are the Hi-Lo on Lincoln, north of Irving. There's lots of  stuff for 10 cents. Marathon Products at Randolph and Halsted is  another good place.

If you can survive on just one meal a day, you're set. The  city has just opened 14 free lunch centers throughout the town.  They are located at:
